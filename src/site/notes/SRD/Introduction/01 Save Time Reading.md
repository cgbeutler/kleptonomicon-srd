This book is divided into 2<!--TODO How many!?--> parts. They are as follows:
* Part 1 - Core Mechanics - An overview of the basic rules of the game.
* Part 2 - Character Sheet - A page-by-page look at the character sheet and explanations of the related, remaining rules of the game.

For simplicity, the first two **Parts** of this book will be written directly to the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Players]] (not the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|Game Master]].)

## Glossary
This book assumes that you have some knowledge of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Tabletop Roleplaying Game\|Tabletop Roleplaying Games]]. As such, you may come across terms that you do not recognize. All of those terms can be found in the **Glossary** with a full description and some examples. If you are reading this book digitally, you can also click on a term to go to its **Glossary** definition.

## Appendix
Most of this book will go over the general rules and guidelines for the game. The **Appendix**, on the other hand, contains the lists of content for the game, such as [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], #Status_Conditions, map features (like [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Zone\|Zones]]), and so much more.

So, for rules you should look in the main book (possibly starting in the **Glossary**) while for content built atop those rules, you should turn to the **Appendix**.

## Callouts
Callouts can help you save time while reading.

Below are examples of each type of callout and how it is used:

> [!caution] Caution: ...
> Cautionary notes on pitfalls or common mistakes. Caution Boxes are more *important* to read than other boxes.

> [!tip] Tip: ...
> The "Tip" boxes point out strategies and rule implications that may not be immediately apparent.


> [!novice] Novice Note: ...
> The "Novice Note" boxes are mainly for those new to Table Top Roll Playing Games.

> [!veteran] Veteran Note: ...
> The "Veteran Note" boxes are for those familiar with TTRPGs. These often explain things more succinctly using other TTRPGs as examples.

> [!gm] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] Note: ...
> Most of this book is written for and to the Players except for the "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] Note" boxes. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] Notes provide tips or rule details that the "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|Game Master]]" may need to know, but that Players can generally skip reading.


> [!eg] Example(s)
> The "Example(s)" boxes show examples of the game in action.
> 
> Most examples will use the characters #Alice, #Bob, #Carol, and #Dave to describe situations. These characters also have complete character sheets found in the Appendix.


## Blocks
Blocks will be used for things like #Items and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]]. These blocks will look similar to callouts, but will contain everything you need to know about the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]], #Item, etc.

For example, here is the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Melee Attack\|Melee Attack]] from the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities\|Basic Ability List]] **Appendix** (the details of how to read these blocks will be explored in later chapters):

The attack deals 2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid/Blunt Damage]] (unless the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] agrees that it should be a different [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Damage Type]] or amount.)
