The overall goal of the game is for *everyone* playing to have fun.

Below are tips for getting the most out of your first game.

##### Thou Shalt Not Memorize This Book
Don't worry about learning every single rule in this book. Everyone playing should work together to slowly learn the rules without letting that process get in the way of the story or the fun. Keep in mind that this book is *not perfect* and not gospel. If you ever find that the game is no longer fun, discuss your frustrations or boredom with your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] or your party. They can then help adjust the game, rules, or your character to help address the issue.

##### Thou Shalt Play *With* Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]], Not Against Them
Work with the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] to build up your character's story. Don't be afraid to discuss your character with your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] throughout the game. They are your ally in crafting a good story. By discussing your character's inner thoughts and your character's overall developments with your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]], your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will get a better sense of how to weave your character into the story. You should even discuss your overall goals with the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] in private between sessions to help create story arcs that other players will enjoy seeing unfold. It will often be more rewarding to surprise other players than to attempt to surprise or work around the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]].

##### Thou Shalt Not Assume New Rules
Unless your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] says otherwise, you should not events in a session as new rulings about how the game will work going forward. If the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] makes a tweak to the rules and doesn't note it as a new rule for future sessions, it should be treated as a situational exception, _not_ a new rule. Before you assume a previous situational bonus will apply, you may want to ask your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]]. A large part of writing a good story together is keeping things fresh and balanced. Some bonuses are given to reward fresh and clever ideas, not set a precedence for the rest of the game. Respect that, as a player, you will always want more power than the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] can grant you. If you feel the game as become unfairly tilted against you, discuss that privately with your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] between sessions, never *at* the table.

##### Thou Shalt Communicate Your Character Control Boundaries
It is helpful to discuss the level of control that you and your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will have over your character. Do you want the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] to be able to surprise you with a relative or past lover? Can the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] cut off your character's arm without consent or warning? Or would you prefer some warning before either of those things were to happen? Would you prefer that the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] get your consent before large changes are made cannon?

Some players enjoy the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] taking their character's fate more fully into their hands, while others prefer a softer hand of fate or a more consent-driven style of play. Understanding and agreeing to how much surprise and consent the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] should involve in the game can make a big difference in preventing frustration or hurt feelings at the table. You may discover that your preferences on this issue shift as you get to know your character. It is up to you to inform the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] of that shift.

Don't be afraid to ask for retcons or tweaks to the scene at hand if it doesn't align with the greater vision for your character. That said, you should strive to be open to the creativity of others, as it will help endear your character to other players if they feel they can contribute to that character's story.

The chapter '[[Character Concept\|Character Concepts]]' will go over tips on how to discuss this balance of control before the game begins. If ever you feel a line has been crossed, don't be afraid to ask for a pause in the game to discuss what has happened with your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]].

##### Thou Shalt Not Play Ellen Ripley, Mad Max, Or Hannibal Lector As Your First Character
When building your first character, you may feel drawn toward building a flawlessly cool action hero, a mysterious lone-wolf, or a backstabbing sociopath. These archetypes are difficult to play well while not ruining the fun of others at the table. For your first time playing, I'd suggest setting a goal to be the beloved side character that others feel drawn to keep safe. Make a flawed, grounded character that is ultimately needed by, and loyal to, the party. Try to figure out how you would answer the following questions:
* What does my character wish they could change about themselves, if they only could?
* Why would the other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|Player Characters]] want and need me around when hanging out around camp?
* Why does my character always seem to get involved in things?

I can guarantee that, for your first time, you will have more fun playing Samwise Gamgee than Aragorn or playing Robin over Nightwing. That moment when you ask your fellow teammate to hold your hand, "cuz you're scared," will stick with them more than any killing blow you make.
