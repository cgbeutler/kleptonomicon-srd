The game will play out in different arcs or stretches of the game referred to as [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episodes]]. Each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]] will test your mettle, as things like healing and some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] will be limited within each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]]. An [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]] is usually played in a single sitting of several hours, but can be split up or drawn out, if needed.

## Opening Credits
At the start of each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]], the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will be go around the table and do the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Opening Credits\|Opening Credits]]. Each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Player]] will introduce themselves and their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|Player Character]]. To help add some immediate flavor, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may also ask you to describe a 5 second, opening credits-style "clip" of your character. This could be as simple as your character sharpening their knife, playing cards, or eating cabbages. This scene does not have to have anything to do with the rest of the game, but should capture a few core vibes of your character.

After introductions have been made, anyone that has [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episodic\|Episodic Abilities]] can use them. These [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] often grant points or effects that can only be used during that same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]].

## Closing Credits
At the end of each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]], the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will announce [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Closing Credits\|Closing Credits]] by asking the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Players]] if they would like to play out any "resolution" style scenes, where their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|Player Character]] discusses the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode's]] events with other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|Player Characters]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] like their friends or family. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may preface their request with restrictions on when and where the scene should take place.

Once the resolution scenes are done, you will have an opportunity to rest and reset many values on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]]. Below is a list of things reset when you rest, though [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] may introduce more as you play. (Each of these values will be covered in [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet\|Part 2: Character Sheet]]):
* Set your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Recovery\|Recoveries]] at their maximum.
* Set your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Dodge Point\|Dodge Points]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]] to the maximum (see the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Rest\|Rest Ability]].)
* Set your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]] to their maximums.
* Clear all [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]].
* Reset all other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Point Bank\|Point Banks]] are reset.

If two [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episodes]] are closer together in time, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may modify what all you can reset.
