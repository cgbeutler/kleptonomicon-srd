Learning to navigate the world without being detected will help you succeed at heists, espionage, and so much more. No matter your stats or skills, you can participate in covert operations.

It is the default assumption that you will try to be stealthy. As such, you do not need to announce that you are using stealth or sleight of hand. On the contrary, if your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] asks for a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] and you want to be nonchalant or obvious about something, you should let your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] know.

The way covert operations are played works differently in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Freeplay\|Freeplay]] than it does during an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]]. [[#Freeplay Covert Operations]] will rely on storytelling over a strict set of rules while  [[#Encounter Covert Operations]] will be much more strict and involve getting caught more often. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will often use a mix of both, depending on how elevated the hunt for you has become.

Regardless of which type of covert operation you are undertaking, you will need to be aware of your [[#Sneaky Status]] and the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert Status]] of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]].
### Sneaky Status
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will generally start off most scenarios with all [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Players]] being given the "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]]" status. While you have the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status, [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] may have trouble predicting your movements.

While [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]], you will have an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] when targeting [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]]. You will also be able to use the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Sneak Attack\|Sneak Attack]], [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Sneak Dash\|Sneak Dash]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Sneak Evade\|Sneak Evade]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reactions]].

You will need to be careful, as it is easy to lose your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status. You can lose your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status in the following ways:
* If you deal damage to someone or something without killing it.
* If you use the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Sneak Attack\|Sneak Attack]], [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Sneak Dash\|Sneak Dash]], or [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Sneak Evade\|Sneak Evade]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] and its effect states that you lose your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status.
* If an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] gains _more than_ two stacks of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]] as a result of your actions (most likely from you doing poorly on a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].)
* If an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] takes a turn to act and you are caught out in the open without any cover or camouflage. (Outside of an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]], the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will generally try to make it clear when this danger is approaching, like by informing you that the person appears to have finished writing their letter and is scooting out their chair to stand up.)

It is easy to regain your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status by using the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Sneak\|Sneak Ability]] at any point on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]].

If you or one of your party members loses their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status, that can make all enemies fully [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] and start an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]]. If it wasn't you that triggered that moment, you can retain your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status going into the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]].

## Freeplay Covert Operations
**Freeplay Covert Operations** occur in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Freeplay\|Freeplay]] phase of the game and relying more on storytelling and creativity. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will generally impose a loose turn order during [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Freeplay\|Freeplay]] to give each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Player]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] their own turn to act.

### Alert
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] you come across will start with zero stacks of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]]. As they gain stacks of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]], they may alter their behavior, becoming more likely to detect you. The number of stacks of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] that a creature has is easily identifiable by observing them for a few seconds. Below is a list of how an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC's]] behavior may change for each stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]]:
* **Alert 0:** Clueless. This [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] does not know of your presence.
	* This [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] will go about their routines or patrols as usual.
	* If an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] starts, this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] will begin with two stacks of the [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]].
* **Alert 1:** Bothered. This [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] is noticing out-of-place sights and sounds and is becoming more conscious of what's around them. They are more ready if something were to happen.
	* This [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] will cautiously go about their usual routines or patrols, occasionally stopping to look around or listen for noises.
	* If an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] starts, this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] will begin with one stack of the [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]].
* **Alert 2:** Alarmed. This [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] is alarmed by the sights and sounds around them and knows something is there that shouldn't be.
	* This [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] will leave their routines or patrols to actively search. While looking for the source of the disturbance, they will start with the location in which they last heard or saw something or the location in which you last failed a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. If actual evidence your presence is found, they may continue and expand their search.
	* This [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] may seek out help from allies within sight and sound range, giving them a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]]. This will generally only happen if they find evidence of possible danger or if they know you are in the area due to you losing your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status against them within the last few hours. They will generally not bother their allies until such proof exists.
	* If this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] would gain another stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]], the creature that triggered that stack will lose their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status.

As you may have noticed, having one or two stacks of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] are not too different from one another beyond roleplaying frills. This initial stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] gives [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Players]] a small grace period when performing longer covert operations.

An [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] will generally increase one stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] if you fail a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. If a creature is on guard duty, they may start with one stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] for the beginning portion of their shift.

Most [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] will lose a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] if they have searched all logical places for you and not found anything. They may also lose a level of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] if it has been 5 to 15 minutes of in-game time and no one have failed a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] near them. If you were directly discovered by an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]], it could take that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] longer to fully lose their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]], maybe even hours. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may remove a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] from an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] sooner if you take clever steps to belay their suspicion (like summoning a goat to be a noise-scapegoat.)

### Covert Test
While you are [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] and using [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], or just hiding within [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Shooting Distance]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|True Swinging Distance]] of an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]], you will most likely need to perform a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]]. The three [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skills]] each cover different cases for when you are in danger of drawing attention:
* [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Stealth]]:
	* When you may be heard or seen while using [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]].
	* When performing feats of finesse that require more of your body, like crossing a patch of broken glass without making any noise.
* [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Sleight]]:
	* When you may be heard while using [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] or tacking a course of action that could make [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Noise\|Noise]]. (Can be triggered within a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|True Shooting Distance]].)
	* When performing feats of dexterity that mainly involve your hands, like pick-pocketing someone or using sleight of hand to obscure your movements.
* [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Hiding]]:
	* When you may be detected while hiding and someone else is using [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] and taking a course of action could reveal your location.
	* When you hold still and attempt to magically ward yourself from the awareness or notice of others.

The result of a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] will determine if nearby creatures gain a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]]. For each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]], the roll result is the same:
* \[..6\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Low Score]]. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] within range gain two stacks of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]].
* \[7..9\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]]. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] within range gain one stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]].
* \[10..\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|High Score]]. No effect.

###### Covert Bonuses
You will gain an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] on a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] for each of the following that is true:
* The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] are distracted or preoccupied in some way.
* The triggering activity was [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Noise\|Quiet]].
###### Covert Penalties
You will gain a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] for each of the following that is true:
* You are in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Spitting Distance]] of an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]].
* The triggering activity was [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Noise\|Loud]].

###### Other Interactions
There are many other ways to get an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] or a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]]. For example a [[SRD/Appendix/Zone List/Dark Zone\|Dark Zone]] or a [[SRD/Appendix/Zone List/Fog Zone\|Fog Zone]] can help you avoid visual detection. Similarly, [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] that are at risk of being heard can be made with an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] if you are in a [[SRD/Appendix/Zone List/Loud Zone\|Loud Zone]].

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may also waive a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] entirely if you are acting in a particularly clever way to hide yourself or mitigate the circumstances that may get you caught.

#### Hiding
When not in an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]], you should try not to stay out in the open. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will often introduce a threat to your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status by warning you that an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] will soon take their turn. If you have failed a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] and an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] now has 2 stacks of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]], they will likely take a turn to search for you immediately after you finish your turn to act. If they see you out in the open on their turn, you will immediately lose your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status. If you are instead hiding, but could _possibly_ be seen or heard, then you will need to make a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] to remain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] if they search near where you are hiding. In the event that your hiding place has no way of being discovered, you will likely be able to skip the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] and remain hidden with ease, provided that your hiding place is not an obvious place to search.

You can generally #hide behind anything that would grant you at least 1/2 cover. You can also #hide in ways that may obscure or camouflage you in some way. #Hiding can be as simple as going [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Prone\|Prone]] in tall grass, jumping in a line of decorative suits of armor, crouching against a busy-looking pile of junk, or joining the crowd of goons with your cloak drawn. If you are not completely hidden, you will likely need to make [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] to help determine how long you can evade their attention. Most creatures that are in-tune with magic can use a bit of that magic to warp attention around them, making them slippery to the mind, but trying to hide out in the open will often incur a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].

## Encounter Covert Operations

Once an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] has started, #covert_operations immediately shift to use a different set of rules. In an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]], your enemies can, without reservation, target and move toward you, even if you are hidden [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]]. That said, your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status gives you access to powerful #covert_reactions that you can use to retcon stealthy activities into the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] that can take place before the opposing creature can finish their actions.

In some instances, your #covert_reactions will not be enough to take you out of harm's way. In those cases your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] state allows you to half the damage taken (rounded down) on any enemy [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] that happen to target you.

Learning to use #covert_reactions to get the jump on enemies, stay once step ahead of them, or avoid their notice completely will drastically improve your survivability and make you a true professional of the underground.
### Covert Reactions
There are three #covert_reactions on the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities\|Basic Ability List]] that every adventurer should know.

All three #covert_reactions from the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities\|Basic Ability List]] have the same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Trigger]]:

> ***Reaction Trigger:*** You can use this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] if you are [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] and a creature is about to harm or otherwise affect you in some way. You can also use this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] if a creatures enters #notice_range of you. This reaction takes effect _before_ any triggering [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] take effect.

Each of the #covert_reactions requires a different [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] for its [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. If you fail the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]], you don't get to use the #covert_reaction, but you do get your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] back. If you get at least a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]] on the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]], then the #covert_reaction takes place.
###### Sneak
Requires a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Stealth Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]] means you gain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] as from the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Dash\|Dash]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] and you can immediately use the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] gained. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|High Score]] means you also remain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] afterward.

Most often, your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] will be used to take you out of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] of an assailant. Those enemies will then have to use additional [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]], perhaps wasting an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] of their own to [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Dash\|Dash]], attack you at range, or give up the chase altogether and focus their attention elsewhere.
###### Attack
Requires a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Sleight Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]] lets you perform a [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Melee Attack\|Melee Attack]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Ranged Attack\|Ranged Attack]] as a part of this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]]. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|High Score]] means you also remain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] afterward.

Since you are [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] for this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]], your attacks can be made with an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]].
###### Hide
Requires a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Hiding Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]] means that you will remain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] and that the creature that triggered the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] will unable to directly target you with any attacks. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|High Score]] also means that no other creature will be able to directly target you until the start of your next turn or until you lose your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status, whichever comes first.

The #hiding [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] is a great way to lay low and avoid damage while your allies draw attention away from you.

### Escaping From An Encounter
While in an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]], you may want to try to end the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] by slipping away silently. To do so, all of your party members will need to become and remain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] for one full [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]] of play. Doing so will result in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] entering an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] being paused and the rules of a [[#Freeplay Covert Operations|Freeplay Covert Operation]] being used once more. Each creature that was in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] will begin with two stacks of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] and a loose turn order will be maintained. At the end of each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Freeplay\|Freeplay]] turn, they will lose a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]], provided that they did not find any additional evidence of you. It is up to the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] to determine when the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] actually ends. Generally, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will wait until you have fully evaded everyone and moved out of the area.

### Example Covert Operation

> [!eg] Examples: Sneaking through a goblin camp.
> The party is sneaking through a goblin camp with 6 goblins in it. Below is an example of Freeplay stealth.
> * The party is sneaking and gets close to 3 of the goblins.
> * Most players get a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|High Score]], but #Bob gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]], which gives a single stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] to all three nearby goblins.
> * The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] announces that a goblin says "Huh?" then slowly turns back to what he was doing.
> * The players continue sneaking, taking a path past 1 goblin with a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] and 1 goblin without a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]]. #Bob again rolls a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]]. This gives a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] to both the goblins.
> * The goblin with two stacks of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] says "What's that!?" The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] announces that each player has one more [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] before the goblins take a turn.
> * The players all choose to try to find #hiding places. #Alice and #Carol go [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Prone\|Prone]] in the tall grass while #Bob jumps behind a bush.
> * Because #Bob used [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] to find his hiding place, and he is still in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Shooting Distance]], #Bob must make another [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Stealth Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. #Bob fails the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. Since one of the goblins was already at two stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]], #Bob loses his [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status.
> * The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] announces the start of an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]].
> 
> Now an encounter has started. Below is an example of encounter stealth.
>  * The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn Order\|Turn Order]] is rolled to get: #Carol, #Alice, Guard Goblins, #Bob, then the other Goblins.
> * Since 2 goblins had no stacks of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]], they start with two stacks of the #slowed_condition and the #restrained_condition. There are also 2 goblins with one stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]]. They begin with one stack of the #slowed_condition and the #restrained_condition.
> * #Carol decides to take advantage of the surprise, attacking a guard goblin with an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]]. #Carol loses her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status.
> * #Carol then jumps behind a bush and uses her second action to hide, regaining her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status.
> * #Alice starts her turn.
> * #Alice casts a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Spell Ability\|Spell Ability]] with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]]. #Alice damages the three closer goblins and loses her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status.
> * #Alice uses her second action to #hide, regaining her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status.
> * It is now the turn of the three [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] goblins.
> * One goblin attacks #Bob, dealing some damage.
> * A different [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Alert\|Alert]] goblin walks up to #Carol to attack. #Carol uses a #covert_reaction to try and attack the goblin first. #Carol rolls her #sleight_skill for a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]]. #Carol successfully attacks the goblin with an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]], then loses her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status. The goblin then attacks #Carol back.
> * The final Goblin walks up to #Alice and attacks. #Alice uses a #covert_reaction to remain hidden. She rolls her #hiding_skill and gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|High Score]]. No goblins will be able to attack #Alice until her next turn is over. The goblin decides to attack #Bob instead.
> * #Bob takes his turn. #Bob attacks a goblin twice.
> * The rest of the goblins take their turn, attacking various people.
> * After a round of combat and killing a few goblins, the heroes decide that the goblin chief is too difficult and that they should sneak away.
> * The heroes each take the #hide action.
> * At one point the goblin chief performs a sweeping attack that would hit two of our [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] heroes, #Alice and #Bob. #Alice gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]] on her #hiding_skill [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]], meaning she cannot be targeted and remains [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]]. #Bob gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]] on his #sneaking_skill [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. #Bob evades the attack but is no longer [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]].
> * Because #Bob lost his [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status, the players must spend a whole second round trying to remain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]]. This time they succeed.
> * Gameplay transitions to a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]]/paused_phase and a more loose style of #covert_operations.
