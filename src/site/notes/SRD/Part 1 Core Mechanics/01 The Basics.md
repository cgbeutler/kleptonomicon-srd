## Common Tabletop Roleplaying Game Terms
The following are common terms that may be new to new players.

##### Tabletop Role Playing Games
**Tabletop Role Playing Games** (or **TTRPGs**) are interactive storytelling adventures where players assume the roles of characters within a fictional world. Together, the players will use their imagination to write a story together. The framework of rules provided within this book will help in molding a shared view of the fictional world, laying down guidelines for what is and isn't possible.

##### Game Master
The **Game Master** (or **GM**) is the player that act as the lead storyteller for your the game. The **GM** creates and manages the world and the challenges found within it. The **GM** also role-plays for all [[#Non-Player Character]] (or [[#Non-Player Character|NPCs]]) that you come across in the world. The **GM** acts as a referee and the final arbiter on all rules. The **GM** can choose to replace or ignore rules if it helps improve the experience for everyone playing.

The [[#Game Master|GM]] should also act as the number one fan of the other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Players']] characters, helping give each character time to shine. There is no "main character" overall, meaning it is up to the [[#Game Master|GM]] to ensure that all characters have their time in the limelight.

##### Non-Player Character
A **Non-Player Character** (or **NPC**) is a character played primarily by the [[#Game Master|GM]]. This term covers both allies and enemies alike. Many **NPCs** will have their own capabilities, goals, and story lines that you should strive to remember and interact with. Making the right friend could greatly help your success. Similarly, making enemies is a good way to ensure that you have countless issues on the road to come.

##### Player Character
A **Player Character** (or **PC**) is a character primarily created and roleplayed by one of the **Players** (*not* the [[#Game Master|GM]].) Each **Player Character** has a [[#Character Sheet]] that defines their overall strengths and capabilities.

Playing a **Player Character** will involve role-playing that character in social situations and using the character's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] to solve puzzles and fight enemies.

Before you begin playing, you will work with your [[#Game Master|GM]] to create a character. Your character will have a unique set of capabilities. All of these will be noted on your [[#Character Sheet]].

##### Character Sheet
A **Character Sheet** is the primary reference sheet for the capabilities of a [[#Player Character]]. Each **Character Sheet** lays out a unique set of capabilities. Together with the dice, the **Character Sheet** contains most of the information you will need to play that character (aside from knowing the basic rules, of course.)

Strive to familiarize yourself with your **Character Sheet**, as it will really help you solving problems and conflicts effectively. That said, don't be afraid to improvise things not found on your **Character Sheet**. Try to view your [[#Player Character]] as a real person that could attempt anything a real person is capable of. If the act is basic enough, you will usually be able to perform that act and move on with the game. However, if the act takes some skill or has some risk involved, the [[#Game Master|GM]] may have you make you roll dice to determine how well your character did on that improvised activity.

The **Character Sheet** will be covered in-depth in [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet\|Part 2]].

### Dice Shorthand
Dice are often referred to using a **Dice Shorthand** consisting of a 'd' followed by a number of faces. For example, `d4` refers to the 4-sided die, `d20` refers to the 20-sided die, and so on. A number listed before the 'd' indicates the total number of dice to roll of the specified type. For example, `2d4` means you will roll 2 of the 4-sided dice. When rolling more than one die, you will generally sum the dice (unless stated otherwise) and use the sum you got for the rest of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] ([[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] are discussed further in [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/02 Dice Mechanics\|02 Dice Mechanics]].)

> [!eg] Example
> 
> - Roll `2d10`
> 	- #Alice rolls two of the 10-sided dice. She gets a `4` and a `6`.
> 	- #Alice sums the two dice to get `10`.
> 	- #Alice's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] for this roll is `10`.

While playing [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Kleptonomicon\|The Kleptonomicon]], you will generally only use a `d10` (or a ten-sided die.)
