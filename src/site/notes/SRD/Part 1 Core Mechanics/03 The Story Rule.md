Many [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Tabletop Roleplaying Game\|Tabletop Roleplaying Game]] rely on strict rules and limitations. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Kleptonomicon\|The Kleptonomicon]] takes a more *laissez faire* approach, giving players a bit more freedom. As a result you will often come across mechanics that could easily break the world and the game. That is where the **Story Rule** comes in.

The **Story Rule** states:
> If a mechanic or course of action would ruin the story being told, then it is against the rules. Conversely, if a missing mechanic or course of action would make for a better story, then it should be allowed.

While it sounds simple on its face, the **Story Rule** is a tricky one to get right. For the **Story Rule** to work, all [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Players]] and the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] need to be equals. A truly good [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] is not an author, but the lead in a writer's room. A truly good [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Player]] is not a main character, but a catalyst for a narrative greater than themselves.

Anyone can suggest to the table that **Story Rule** is beginning to break. From there, everyone should discuss what can be done moving forward. Often, this will result in an overpowered or "broken" solution being allowed once, but then retired for more fresh game-play. If ever your ideas are not allowed to proceed, work to understand why and what greater narrative the others at the table are trying to tell.

## The Moral Story Rule
One way to bring a lot of strength to the **Story Rule** is to try to maintain strong moral borders for the world. If murder is viewed as seriously as it is in the real world (even against goblins or other lowly creatures) then players will have to get creative or try to coax their opponents into surrendering. If stealing from lowly merchants is viewed as wrong, then players will need to figure out a good offer-in-trade. While it may sound lame to some, I would encourage trying out the **Moral Story Rule**. Setting aside chaotic and murder hoboey tendencies may just surprise you on how rich your stories can become.

That said, a full chaotic campaign is definitely still fun... once in awhile.
