> [!veteran] Veteran Note: New terms and mechanics
> This chapter discusses mechanics that may be partially or wholly different from what you've seen before. If you recognize a term below, you may still want to skim the section to learn what is different here in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Kleptonomicon\|The Kleptonomicon]].

## Tests
While adventuring, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will occasionally ask you to perform a "**Test**". When this happens, you will roll the dice then apply some alterations to the result on the die to determine your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] for the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].

For most [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]], you will be rolling a `d10` and adding a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] to determine your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]]. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that brought about the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] will tell you which [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] to use, usually using the name of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]]. Occasionally, you will also perform other modifications to the roll before determining your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]], like rolling with an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] or a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]].

Your final [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] of a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] is then used to determine how well your character performed a certain task. The term '[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]]' will *always* be used to refer to the final result of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] (after all [[#Modifiers]], [[#Advantage|Advantages]], [[#Disadvantage|Disadvantages]], and other modifications have been applied.) If the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] ever asks for your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]], just know that they want the *final result* instead of the raw value shown on the dice.

Occasionally the term [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] will simply be used alongside the name of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] you are being asked to roll with. For example, if you are asked for a "**Sneaking Score**" or a "**History Score**," just know that that means you will perform a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] using your **Sneaking** or **History** [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]], respectively, to determine your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]]. If you are new to the game, don't be afraid to ask for help in figuring out what you need for each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].

### Modifiers
A **Modifier**, (sometimes called a "**Mod**" for short), is a fixed value added to or subtracted from the total sum of a dice roll. The shorthand for a **Modifier** is written as a '`+`' or '`-`' followed by a number. When a **Modifier** is preceded by a [[#Dice Shorthand]], you will simply roll the dice specified, then add the **Modifier** to the sum of the dice.

On your [[#Character Sheet]], you will find many named **Modifiers** with no [[#Dice Shorthand]] before them. In these cases the die rolled with the **Modifier** will be a `d10`.

If you are unsure what to roll, ask your [[#Game Master|GM]] or another experienced player. They will be happy to help you figure it out.

> [!eg] Examples
> 
> - Roll `2d12 +3`
> 	- #Alice rolls 2 of the 12-sided dice. The sum of the dice ends up being `10`.
> 	- #Alice adds the **Modifier** of '+3' to get the value `13`.
> 	- #Alice's final sum is `13`.
> - Roll a "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Focus Save]]".
> 	- #Alice looks up the **Modifier** on her [[#Character Sheet]] named "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Focus Save]]". The **Modifier** is a `+1`.
> 	- #Alice roll a 10-sided die. She got an `8`. #Alice adds her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Focus Save]] **Modifier** of `+1` to her 10-sided die's result to get `9`.
> 	- #Alice's final [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Focus Save]] sum is `9`.

#### Critical Rolls
When a `10` is rolled (often labeled a `0` on a `d10`), you have gotten a "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Roll]]". When you get a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Roll]], you will then need to flip a coin to determine if you get a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Success]] or a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Failing Score]]. If you do not have a coin, you can simply roll again, treating an odd result as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Failing Score]] and an even result as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Success]].

If you roll a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Success]], your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is counted as being the bests it could be, regardless of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] for the roll. It is still possible to fall short of accomplishing what you intended, but the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will grant you a positive side effect (even if it is just information or a temporary boost to your next [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]].) Similarly, if you roll a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Failing Score]], your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is counted as being the lowest it could possibly be, regardless of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] for the roll. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Failing Score]] could mean that you do still accomplish the task, but that you will likely experience a negative side effect (like getting injured or experiencing a setback of some kind.)

> [!note] Note: The d10ish Die
> If you do not like having to flip a coin for each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Roll]], you can instead use a "d10ish" die. The die is a 20-sided die that has the values '`1`' through '`9`' repeated twice while there is only one '`0`' face and one '`10`' face. Rolling the '`0`' or the '`10`' results in a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Failing Score]] or a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Success]], respectively.
> 
> Below is a histogram depicting the faces of the die to help demonstrate how most numbers have a 10% chance, except '`0`' and '`10`', which have a 5% chance:
> ```
>   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
> ```
> 
> You can also roll a d10ish die using this free website: http://d10ish.com
> If you have a 3D printer, a free file is available for the d10ish here: https://makerworld.com/en/models/861559-d10ish-20-sided-d10-but-5-crits

#### Advantage and Disadvantage
Some circumstances will place you at an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] or a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] while performing various activities. In these circumstances, additional dice are used to represent the temporary changes in your ability to perform.

All [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantages]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]], unless otherwise stated, remain in effect until the circumstances that brought them about come to an end. For example, if you have an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] to your attack because an enemy has ants in their pants, you will be able to apply that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] to all relevant [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] until the foe has dealt with the ants. For official [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], their description will explain the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] that each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] can be applied to as well as what conditions will end those [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantages]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]].
###### Advantage
For each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] you have on a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] you will roll an additional `d10`, keeping track of the highest die result. The highest die result will then be used to calculate the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].
###### Disadvantage
For each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] you have on a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] you will roll an additional `d10`, keeping track of the lowest die result. The lowest die result will then be used to calculate the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].
###### Canceling Out
When you have both [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantages]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]], they cancel each-other out at a rate of one-to-one. After canceling, the total number of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantages]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]] that remain is capped at 3 (to help save time.) This means you will only ever need 4 or fewer 10-sided dice for any one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].
###### Resolving Critical Rolls
If a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Roll]] is rolled as one of the dice in an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] roll, resolve the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Roll]] into a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Success]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Failing Score]] before figuring out what the highest or lowest die is. This may mean you can avoid a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Failing Score]] if you are rolling with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] and get a different, better result. It also means you may miss out on a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Success]] if you are rolling with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] and get a different, lower result.

> [!eg] Examples
> 
> - Roll with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]].
>   - #Alice rolls `2d10` (one extra die due to her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]]) and gets: `4` and `8`.
>   - #Alice discards all but the high die of `8` for the rest of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].
>   - #Alice adds her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]], turning the `8` into a `10`.
>   - #Alice's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] for this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] is `10`.
> - Roll with two [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]].
>   - #Alice rolls `3d10` (two extra dice due to having two [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]]) and gets; `6`, `4`, and `9`.
>   - #Alice discards all but the low die of `4` for the rest of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].
>   - #Alice adds her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] to the die result, turning her `4` into a `6`.
>   - #Alice's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] for this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] is `6`.
> - Roll with five [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantages]] and one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]].
>   - #Alice cancels one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] with one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]]. #Alice now has four [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantages]].
>   - #Alice caps the number of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantages]] at the maximum of 3 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantages]].
>   - #Alice rolls `4d10` (three extra dice due to having three [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantages]]) and gets: `1`, `4`, `8`, and `2`.
>   - #Alice discards all but the high die of `8` for the rest of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].
>   - #Alice adds her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] to the die result, turning her `4` into a `6`.
>   - #Alice's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] for this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] is `6`.
> 
> When you get a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Roll]] while you have an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]], you will need to resolve the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Roll]] before determining the high or low result. Below is are examples to demonstrate this:
> - Roll with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]]
>   - #Alice rolls `2d10` (one extra die due to her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]]) and gets: `4` and `10`(sometimes on the dice as`0`.) The `10` is a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Roll]].
>   - #Alice flips a coin for the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Roll]] and chose wrong. The roll is now counted as a `0` and a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Failure]].
>   - #Alice discards the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Failure]] and uses the `4` as her roll for the rest of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].
>   - #Alice adds her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]], turning the `4` into a `5`.
>   - #Alice's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is `5`.
> 
> Note: If the above example were with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] instead of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]], the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Failure]] would have been the die chosen and used for the rest of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].

## Score Ranges
After you perform a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]], your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] will be compared against several **Score Ranges** to determine what effects, if any, become active.

**Score Ranges** are written using a shorthand. The shorthand uses an *inclusive* range of numbers surrounded by square brackets. For a majority of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]], you will see one or more of the following **Score Ranges**:

| Score Range |               Name               | Description                                  |
| :---------: | :------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------- |
|    [..6]    |  **[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Low Score]]**  | Bad things will likely result.               |
|   [7..9]    | **[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]]** | You may succeed, but likely with a downside. |
|   [10..]    | **[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|High Score]]**  | You succeed, usually with no downside.       |

> [!novice] Novice Note: Remembering the Score Ranges
> It won't take long to learn these ranges, but an easy way to remember them is by viewing them as grade-school grades. A '**Low Score**' of 6 or lower is like a 60% or lower in school, which is a 'D' or 'F'. These are usually failing grades. A '**Mixed Score**' of 7 through 9 is like a 70% to a 90%, which is a 'C' to an 'A' grade; not perfect, thus a mixed result. A '**High Score**' of 10 or more is like getting 100% or above, which is an 'A+'.

For some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]], the results will simply be described as a **[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Passing Score]]** or **[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Failing Score]]** (or a **[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Pass]]** or a **[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Fail]]**, respectively.) For those [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]], a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]] or better is considered a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Passing Score]], otherwise it is a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Failing Score]]:

| Score Range |                Name                | Description                                    |
| :---------: | :--------------------------------: | ---------------------------------------------- |
|    [..6]    | **[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Failing Score]]** | Bad things will likely result.                 |
|    [7..]    | **[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Passing Score]]** | You succeeded. Good things will likely result. |

Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] will be described using explicit **Score Ranges** other than the standard ones above. Those custom ranges will be written with the same square-bracket shorthand used above.

Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] may have specific effects for when you get a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Roll]]. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Score Range]] shorthand for a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Failure]] is a `0` or a `10` followed by an exclamation mark:

| Score Range |                  Name                   | Description                            |
| :---------: | :-------------------------------------: | -------------------------------------- |
|    \[0!]    | **[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Failure]]** | Really bad things will likely result.  |
|   \[10!]    | **[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Success]]** | Really good things will likely result. |

> [!eg] Examples
> 
> - #Alice has the Magic Missile Spell. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] uses the following **Score Ranges**:<br>
>   `[..6]` 1 Missile, `[7..9]` 2 Missiles, `[10..]` 3 Missiles.
>   - #Alice rolls to cast **Magic Missile** and get a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] of `8`.
>   - #Alice's **Mixed Score** matches the range `[7..9]`, so #Alice gets 2 Missiles.

## Group Tests
Some situations require a group of players to roll together. In these situations you will be performing a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Group Test\|Group Test]]. At the end of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Group Test\|Group Tests]], the lowest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is used for the entire group. Before the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] ends, however, players that roll well can help other players that did not fare so well.

To make a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Group Test\|Group Test]], all players involved roll their own [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] as normal. Then, based on a player's individual [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]], they can potentially help other players improve their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]]:
* \[7..\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]]. You can give another player an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] to their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].
* \[10..\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|High Score]]. You can give two [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantages]] out to other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Player(s)]] for their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test(s)]].

By giving [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantages]] to other players, you can potentially turn their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Fail]] into a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Pass]]. Remember, at the end of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Group Test\|Group Test]] the lowest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is used for the entire group, so be sure to help other players where you can.

> [!eg] Example
> * #Alice, #Bob, #Carol, and #David are asked to roll a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Stealth Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Group Test\|Group Test]].
> 	* All players roll `1d10` and add their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Stealth Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] to it.
> 	* #Alice got an `8` and #Bob got an `11`. #Alice and #Bob succeed.
> 	* #Carol got a `5` and #David got an `6`. #Carol and #David currently have [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Low Scores]].
> 	* #Alice's `8` lets her give out an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] to another player. #Alice gives one to #David, turning his `6` into a `7`, which is now a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Pass]].
> 	* #Bob's high result lets him give two [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantages]] to #Carol, turning #Carol's `5` into a `7`, which is a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Pass]].
> 	* The lowest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is for the group is a `7`. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Group Test\|Group Test]] results in a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]].

## Contest
A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Contest\|Contest]] involves two parties performing a head-to-head [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]], directly compare their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Scores]] afterward to determine the winner. If one party's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is higher, that party wins the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Contest\|Contest]]. If both [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Scores]] are a tie, a coin toss is used to determine the winner.

Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Contest\|Contests]] will use a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Score Range]] shorthand in their description:
* `[Win]` Takes effect if you get the higher [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Contest\|Contest]].
* `[Lose]` Takes effect if you get the lower [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Contest\|Contest]].
