There are two main phases of play: [[#Freeplay]] and [[#Encounter|Encounters]]

You will start most game sessions playing in a [[#Freeplay Phase]] of the game. During the [[#Freeplay Phase]], players can roleplay and interact with the world without worrying as much about taking turns. When tense moments arise, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may announce the beginning of an [[#Encounter]]. During an [[#Encounter]] you will be limited in what you can do. The game will be played with more strict, time-aware rules and every character will take turns.

---
## Freeplay Phase
During the **Freeplay** portion of the game, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will usually lead by describing the scene and the events unfolding around you. Each player can then choose to act on that information to explore and progress the story.

While **Freeplay** does not have a strict turn-order, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may occasionally impose a loose turn-order to ensure that each player gets a chance to act. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will also often loose a turn-order to add tension into time-sensitive parts of the story. Generally, these turns should be treated as overlapping, in terms of time.

> [!novice] Novice Note: Getting Involved
> A great player will not only find reasons and motivations for their character to get involved, but they will also encourage other player characters to step up to challenges. Situations may arise in which players are hesitant to act. In those moments of indecision you should find a reason to step up or a way to talk another player's character into stepping up for you. This can be particularly helpful to shy or hesitant players that need more "screen time."
> 
> For your first few times playing, you should strive to work together with your fellow players and your characters should strive to become a family, of sorts, that watches out for one another and is "in this together!" After you have experience a more cooperative style of play, it will be easier to explore other dynamics while keeping the game fun for everyone.

During **Freeplay**, you are free to take any actions available to your character. This includes [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] found on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] along with improvised activities that any normal creature could do that may not be covered in this book. Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] may include casting spells or attacking with your weapons.

When you want to improvise something, you will describe what you want to do to the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] and they will describe what, if anything, it would take for that action to take place. For simple tasks like opening a door, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will likely not require anything. If the task is more difficult in some way, like if a door was stuck shut, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may ask that you perform a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] using one of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Skill\|Skills]]. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] you get will then determine how well you performed the improvised activity.

If a task you want to improvise is not possible or is too difficult, like performing open heart surgery in a swamp with not but a dirty stick, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may simply inform you that that task is not possible.

> [!gm] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] Note: Fostering Creativity
> When players suggest outlandish improvised actions, try not to punish them for the suggestion, as that can stifle creativity.
> 
> At times, players may come up with creative solutions that, if allowed, would quickly become a go-to solution or possibly break the game in some way. In these situations, it can help to be forthright with your concerns. A good way to proceed is to allow the player to do their creative solution once, but express ahead of time that you will expect different solutions in the future. You can even inform the players that future attempt at that solution will be allowed, but at a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]]. This allows the players to exercise their creativity while being up-front about your concerns about the story staying fun and interesting for everyone.

---
## Encounter
When tense moments arise or a fight breaks out, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will announce the start of an **Encounter**. During an **Encounter**, the game will be played one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]] at a time with all players involved taking one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] per [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]]. On your turn, you are limited in many ways including the number of things you can do.

An **Encounter** encompasses the following phases of the game:
* [[#Encounter Setup Phase]]: Determine [[#Turn Order]].
* [[#Encounter Main Phase]]: The game proceeds with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Players]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] taking turns in the [[#Turn Order]] created in the setup phase. This order repeats in a series of [[#Rounds]].
* [[#Encounter End Phase]]: The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] announces the end of the **Encounter**. Players gain [[#Experience]] and can [[#Recover]].
* [[#Encounter Paused Phase]]: An optional phase. This phase is similar to [[#Freeplay]], but players cannot use slower [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] (unless the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] makes an exception.)

### Encounter Setup Phases
When the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] announces the start of an [[#Encounter]], the **Encounter Setup Phase** begins. In the **Encounter Setup Phase**, you will determine the [[#Turn Order]] for all [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|PCs]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] involved in the [[#Encounter]].

###### Turn Order
To determine **Turn Order**, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will first group the list of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] by matching [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Edge Save]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifiers]]. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will then sort each group in descending order of their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Edge Save]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifiers]]. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may also choose to divide up a group of like [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] to ensure that there are at least two or three groups of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]]. These groups form the skeleton of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] order. We will now determine where players fit before, after, or between those groups.

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] has all [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|PCs]] involved in the [[#Encounter]] perform a series of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Edge Save]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]], one for each group of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]]. If a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|PC]] gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Low Score]], that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|PC]] is added to the **Turn Order** just after the group of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] being rolled against. If more than one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|PC]] gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Low Score]] for the same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]], they can decide their own order together or compare their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Edge Save]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Scores]] to determine who goes first. If a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|PC]] gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]], they continue on with rolling against the next [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] group. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|PCs]] that happen to get a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]] for all [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] groups get to go first in the **Turn Order**.

If a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|PC]] is [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] from at least one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] in a group of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]], that player may make their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Edge Save]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] with an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] against that group.

> [!eg] Example: Setup Phase
> The players decide to attack a group of enemies.
> * There are three types of enemies with the following [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Edge Save]] scores: Wolves(2), Goblins(1), and Orcs(0). The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] writes them down in that same order.
> * The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] asks the players ( #Alice, #Bob, #Carol, and #David ) to roll a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Edge Save]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] for the first group: the Orcs. The players are [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] from the Orcs, so the players can roll their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Edge Save]] with an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]].
> * #Alice rolls an 10, #Bob rolls a 8, #Carol rolls a 12, and #David rolls a 7. All players got a `7` or higher and announce that they "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Pass]]" the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. The Orcs will go last.
> * The players are asked to roll again, this time to check if they go after the Goblins.
> * #Alice rolls a 3, #Bob rolls an 4, #Carol rolls a 9, and #David rolls a 7. #Alice and #Bob announce that they have "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Failed]]" the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. #Alice and #Bob decide together that #Alice should go first. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] writes #Alice down just after the Goblins in the **Turn Order**, then places #Bob after #Alice.
> * The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] asks for one final roll for the Wolves.
> * #Carol rolls a 10 and #David rolls a 4. #David announces that he "failed." #David is added to the **Turn Order** just after the Wolves.
> * #Carol has passed all [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] and gets added first in the **Turn Order**.
> * The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] announces the final **Turn Order**:
>   #Carol, Wolves, #David, Goblins, #Alice, #Bob, then the Orcs.

### Encounter Main Phase
The **Encounter Main Phase** proceeds with each character in the [[#Turn Order]] taking their [[#Turn]]. Once every character has taken their [[#Turn]], the next [[#Round]] begins and each character takes their [[#Turn]] again, as before. The [[#Encounter]] continues, [[#Round]] after [[#Round]], until the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] pauses it using an [[#Encounter Paused Phase]] or ends it using the [[#Encounter End Phase]].

#### Beats
For each [[#Round]] of an [[#Encounter]], you will have two **Beats** that can be spent to perform [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]]. This includes abilities performed on your [[#Turn]], such as [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Action\|Actions]], and those performed at other points in the round, such as [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reactions]]. Your **Beats** are reset at the _end_ of each of your [[#Turn|Turns]].

Most [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] will use up only one **Beat** (though some may take more, as they take more time to execute.) A more detailed overview of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] and when you will need to spend **Beats** is covered in chapter [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/05 Abilities\|05 Abilities]].
###### Free Actions
Aside from spending your two [[#Beats]], you can perform at least three additional **Free Actions** _on_ your [[#Turn]] that will not use up your [[#Beats]]. **Free Actions** should be simple, fast, or even passive activities that could possibly happen while you use your [[#Beats]]. **Free Actions** include things like talking smack to enemies, pushing over small objects, or opening doors. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may even approve upwards of 5 or more **Free Actions**, if all your **Free Actions** and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Action\|Actions]] could reasonably be done together in a 6s span of time. **Free Actions** are a great way to add flavor to an [[#Encounter]] without worrying about using up your [[#Beats]].
###### Free Reactions
In the same fashion as [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Action\|Free Actions]], you can use [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reactions]] without using up a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]]. Any character can use a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]] to briefly respond to what someone else has said. Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] are also [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reactions]] or allow you to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Prepare\|Prepare]] a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]], which will be covered more in chapter [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/05 Abilities\|05 Abilities]].

#### Turn
Each character's **Turn** represents 6s of time that overlaps everyone else's **Turn** (but is staggered, meaning that each entity's **Turn** starts at a different point in time.) On your **Turn**, you get a chance to move and act on what's happening around you. Since your [[#Beats]] reset at the *end* of your **Turn**, you should try to use all your remaining [[#Beats]] *on* your turn.

##### Movement
Your **Movement** determines how far you can walk, run, and jump on your turn.

The default way of measuring distances in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Kleptonomicon\|The Kleptonomicon]] relies on the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Theater of the Mind\|Theater of the Mind]]. There are five main distances: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Spitting Distance]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Throwing Distance]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Shooting Distance]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Sniping Distance]].

If you would prefer to use a more detailed map with the usual grid, the following conversion chart can be used:

| [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] | [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Spitting Distance]] | [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Throwing Distance]] | [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Shooting Distance]] | [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Sniping Distance]] |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1                               | 4                               | 8                               | 16                              | 200                            |

At the start of each of your [[#Turn|Turns]] you gain **Movement** equal to your highest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]]. You can then spend your gained **Movement** on any of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Ranges]]. Doing so allows you to move in the way defined by that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]]. For example, spending a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] of your **Movement** to [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Walk\|Walk]] lets you walk a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] along a walk-able surface. The amount of **Movement** you can spend into any one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]] is limited by that mode's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]]. For example, all [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|PCs]] start with the ability to [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Walk\|Walk]] a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Spitting Distance]]. After reaching the limits of any one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]], you cannot use that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]] to move again until your next [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] or until you increase the limit of that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]] using an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. For example, [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|PCs]] also begin with the ability to [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]] a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]], which means you can only spend one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] of your **Movement** to [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]], at which point that mode of travel becomes unavailable to you.

**Movement** can be divided up, spending it into any [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]] or combination of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Ranges]] before, after, or between using [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]].

> [!eg] Example: Movement using Units
> #Alice has the following speeds listed on her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]]:
> > [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Walk\|Walk]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Spitting Distance]] (4 units)
> > [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] x2 (2 units)
> 
> #Alice's largest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]] lets her [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Walk\|Walk]] 4 units. #Alice also has a special [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that doubles the usual [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]] for 2 units of jumping.
> * #Alice starts her turn. #Alice gains **Movement** of 4 units (her largest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]]) to use this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]].
> * #Alice spends 1 unit of **Movement** to [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]] that same distance. #Alice has 3 units of **Movement** remaining.
> * #Alice casts a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Spell Ability\|Spell Ability]].
> * #Alice spends another 1 unit of **Movement** to [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]] back to where she was before. Since #Alice has a [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]] of 2 units, so she has now used all the [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]] that she is allowed for this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]]. #Alice has 2 units of **Movement** remaining.
> * #Alice spends her remaining 2 units of **Movement** to [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Walk\|Walk]]. #Alice can [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Walk\|Walk]] up to 4 units, so she is able to walk the full 2 units. #Alice is now out of **Movement** and cannot move any further.
> * #Alice heals someone, then ends her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]].

Each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]] type has unique set of rules as to how it works. For example, some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Ranges]], like [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Fly\|Fly]], can be #interrupted and lead fall damage or other consequences. Other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Ranges]], like a [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]] or a [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Levitate\|Levitate]] can't be #interrupted in the same way, but may have other limitations on how they can be used and what dangers they may incur.

The [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges\|Movement Range List]] appendix contains a full list of all the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Ranges]].
###### Improvised Movement
If you do not explicitly have a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]] listed for your character, that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]] defaults to 0. That said, you are not totally barred from attempting to move in that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range's]] mode of travel.

If ever you want to attempt a mode of travel for which you have a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]] of 0, you can do so with **Improvised Movement**. To use **Improvised Movement**, first discuss with the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] how you plan to accomplish that mode of travel. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may then grant you a temporary [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]] of the improvised type. Unless the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] says otherwise, when you gain **Improvised Movement**, you will have a movement penalty of 2 to 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] spent for distance traveled. For example, if you cannot explicitly [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Climb\|Climb]], but can justify climbing a rocky surface, you will only be able to [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Climb\|Climb]] half the distance of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] you spend to [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Climb\|Climb]]. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may waive this penalty if your improvisation mitigates any difficulties that **Improvised Movement** would normally face. For example, if you tip a bed frame up to create a makeshift ladder, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may waive the improvised [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Climb\|Climb]] penalty, seeing as how the wall is now easier to climb.
###### Terrain Zones
**Zones** are used to represent hazards and rule changes that exist in a given portion of the world. Entering some **Zones**, like a [[SRD/Appendix/Zone List/Fire Zone\|Fire Zone]] may require that you perform a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] to avoid taking damaged. Other **Zones**, like [[SRD/Appendix/Zone List/Dark Zone\|Dark Zones]] may help by making it harder for people to see and attack you.

Each type of **Zone** can be applied to a <span class="dist">1u</span> cube of the world multiple times. Each new "stack" of a **Zone** on the same cube makes the **Zone** stronger and more pronounced. For example, a [[SRD/Appendix/Zone List/Fire Zone\|Fire Zone]] with multiple stacks will deal an extra damage for each stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Zone List/Fire Zone\|Fire Zone]]. Most **Zones** you encounter will only have one or two [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stacks]].

Not all the **Zones** you encounter will be explicitly laid out by the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]], but will logically exist anyway. For example, a dark room will, logically, be a [[SRD/Appendix/Zone List/Dark Zone\|Dark Zone]]. Similarly, a pond may not explicitly be marked as such, but should be treated as an [[SRD/Appendix/Zone List/Airless Zone\|Airless Zone]] for any creature that cannot breathe water.

The [[SRD/Appendix/Zone List\|Zone List]] appendix contains a full list of all the **Zones**. The list is split up into the more common [[SRD/Appendix/Zone List#Core Zones\|Core Zones]] and the less common [[SRD/Appendix/Zone List#Supplemental Zones\|Supplemental Zones]].

> [!important] Note: Printing Zone Reference Cards
> If you are a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] that is planning to use [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Zone\|Zones]] in an upcoming story arch or if you are a player that just picked up a new [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]], it can be helpful to print out a reference card for the zones you will be using. You can then hand the reference to other players to help them learn or remember how those zones work.
###### The Dash Ability
If you ever need more [[#Movement]] on your [[#Turn]], you can also use the core [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Dash\|Dash Ability]]. This [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] doubles all your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Ranges]], meaning your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] is also doubled for the [[#Turn]]. For example, using the core [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Dash\|Dash Ability]] would double your [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]], allowing you to [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]] twice as far or make twice the number of smaller jumps in a single [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]].

Just be aware that if you use the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Dash\|Dash Ability]] a second time in the same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]], you will need to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Pass]] an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Athletics Skill\|Athletics Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] or become [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]].
###### Movement Reactions
You will want to take care as you move around a battlefield. Enemies may be able to take [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reactions]] in response to your movement. The most common [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] you will face will be that of the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Melee Attack\|Melee Attack]], which can be used when you move out of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] of another creature.
##### Ending your Turn
You will often acquire [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]] during an [[#Encounter]], which impose negative or positive effect on you. At the end of each of your [[#Turn|Turns]], you can erase one stack of *each* [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fleeting Condition\|Fleeting Condition]] on your character sheet, provided that you did not acquire that stack _on_ that same [[#Turn]]. Erasing [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]] stacks will lessen or entirely remove the effects of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]]. (For more information on [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]], see the chapter [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet/05 Status Conditions and Saving Throws\|05 Status Conditions and Saving Throws]].)

> [!note] Note: Enemies also erase one stack of each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fleeting Condition\|Fleeting Condition]] at the end of _their_ turn.

> [!note] Note: At the end of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]], you should look to see if the effects of any [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] have expired. You may need update values on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] to reflect those changes.

#### Running an Encounter
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will play all of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] in an [[#Encounter]]. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] can also perform #legendary_abilities tied to certain boss-level enemies or the environment itself.

While only a summary is provided in this chapter, a more complete guide on running encounters from the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM's]] perspective is included in [[Part 3 Chapter ?? Running Encounters \|Part 3 Chapter ?? Running Encounters ]]. <!--TODO: Give the GM a set of "GM_actions" tied to the number of players. Those should be used to perform actions and reactions in an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]]. Helps keep things moving and ensure a bit more balance no matter how many baddies are added.-->
##### [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] Turns
Each **NPC Turn** proceeds in the same way as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Player's]] [[#Turn]]:
* On their [[#Turn]], an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] can:
	* Use [[#Movement]] in accordance with their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Ranges]].
	* The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] can use their two [[#Beats]] to perform [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]].
	* At the end of their [[#Turn]] the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] can clear one stack of each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fleeting Condition\|Fleeting Condition]] that they have.

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPC]] can also use their [[#Beats]] to perform their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] at any other point in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]], provided that the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Trigger]] occurs.

### Encounter End Phase
When the conflict or tension has been resolved, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will announce the end of the [[#Encounter]].

When an [[#Encounter]] has officially ended, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will give you [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Experience Point\|Experience Points]]. You will usually receive only one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Experience Point\|Experience Point]] per [[#Encounter]], but you may be given a second [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Experience Point\|Experience Point]] for achieving a secondary goal or a more optimal or amazing outcome. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Experience Point\|Experience Points]] are tracked on the [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet/08 Tracker Boxes#Experience\|Experience Tracker]] on **Page 3** of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]]. Once you have gained enough [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Experience Point\|Experience Points]], you may be able to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level Up]]. Ask your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] before [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Leveling Up]], as they may want you to wait until the end of the current [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]].

> [!note] Note: Post-encounter recovery.
> If you took damage in an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]], you will want to be sure to use your [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Rest\|Rest Ability]] to recover some health and reset your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]], if it is low. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] will be discussed more in the next chapter [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/05 Abilities\|05 Abilities]].

### Encounter Paused Phase
At times, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may wish to pause an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] without officially ending it. This **Encounter Paused Phase** is used most often for moments when someone calls for a parlay or takes a moment to deliver a monologue. The **Encounter Paused Phase** works the same as [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Freeplay\|Freeplay]], but players are not aloud to use [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] that require more than 6 seconds (or an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Action\|Action]]) to perform without explicit [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] approval. For example, the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Rest\|Recover Ability]] is a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Action]], meaning it takes a whole [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]] to take effect. This means you cannot uses it to heal during the **Encounter Paused Phase** without [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] approval.

The **Encounter Paused Phase** phase usually concludes by transitioning back to the [[#Encounter Main Phase]] or to the [[#Encounter End Phase]].

> [!note] Note: If you trigger the end of a [[#Encounter Paused Phase]] by spending a [[#Beats|Beat]], that [[#Beats|Beat]] will be unavailable on your next [[#Turn]] of the [[#Encounter]].
