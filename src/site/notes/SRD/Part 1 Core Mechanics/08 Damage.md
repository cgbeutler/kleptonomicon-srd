### Damage Types
All damage is categorized using a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Major Damage Type]] and a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Minor Damage Type]].

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Major Damage Types]] are: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Fluid]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Ethereal]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|True Damage]].
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Minor Damage Types]] are: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Blunt]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Sharp]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Shock]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Fire]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Ice]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Caustic]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Planar]].

Each weapon, and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that deals damage will list its [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Major Damage Type]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Minor Damage Type]]. Generally speaking, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Minor Damage Type]] will come up less often in the game, and can often be ignored. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Major Damage Type]], on the other hand, is more useful and can often be reduced by one of your [[#Defenses]].

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Major Damage Type]] of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|True Damage]] is rare and cannot be blocked or reduced in any way. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|True Damage]] type is reserved for the most powerful and piercing of abilities.

Below is a chart that provides basic examples of descriptions of what each **major/minor** combination might represent in your travels. Not all combos are represented here and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|True Damage]] has not been included, as that is often justified more by the context it is found in.

|         | Solid                            | Fluid                               | Ethereal                                                 |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blunt   | Blunt weapons, blunt projectiles | Shockwaves, Crushing Gravity        | Psychic slams, Charms, Silvered blunt weapons vs ghosts  |
| Sharp   | Sharp weapons, sharp projectiles | Sandstorms, Bees                    | Psychic stabs, Insults, Silvered sharp weapons vs ghosts |
| Shock   |                                  | Lightning Strikes                   | Psychic shocks, Paralyzing traumas                       |
| Fire    | Meteors                          | Flames                              | Radiance                                                 |
| Ice     | Solid chunks of ice              | Ice beams, cold auras               | Void Influences, Fears, Dementias                        |
| Caustic | Acids                            | Poisons                             | Necrotics                                                |
| Planar  | Planar instabilities             | Temporal or Spacial inconsistencies | Fey influences, Manias                                   |
Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may choose create new [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Minor Damage Type]] or use combos other than those listed above. Generally speaking, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Major Damage Types]] can be thought of as:
* [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid Damage]] that would be slowed down by armor or physical defenses before it hit you.
* [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Fluid Damage]] that can often seep through cracks of armor or may permeate through cloth, armor, or leather.
* [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Ethereal Damage]] that often bypasses any physical protections you may have.

## Falling
If ever you fall more than <span class="distance">3u</span>, you may be in danger! Lets take a look at the handy chart included on Page 1 of the #cheat_sheet:
![Ref Falling.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/Ref%20Falling.png)
At the top of this chart is the distance that you have fallen. Below that you will find the corresponding amount of damage that you will take and the number of actions you can take *before* you suffer that damage.

As you can see, the distance that you fall correlates directly with the amount of damage that you will take. If you fall <span class="distance">8u</span>, you will suffer 8 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid/Blunt Damage]]. If you fall <span class="distance">79u</span>, you will take 79 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid/Blunt Damage]]. Like with all damage, one tenth of that damage, rounded down, will also be dealt as [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]] damage. For most newly-made characters a fall of only <span class="distance">50u</span> would mean instant death.

Luckily, you have a chance to save yourself before suffering any fall damage! Whenever you have begun to fall, be that by being pushed off a cliff or stunned while flying, the fall itself is not resolved until you have had a chance to take the listed actions on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]].

If you are falling less than <span class="distance">3u</span>, you are fine and can ignore the fall.

If you fall <span class="distance">3u</span> or more, but less than <span class="distance">10u</span>, you can take a #secondary_action on your turn before the fall, and its damage, is resolved.

If you fall <span class="distance">10u</span> or more, but less than <span class="distance">100u</span>, you can take a #primary_action _or_ a #secondary_action on your turn before the fall, and its damage, is resolved.

If you fall more than <span class="distance">100u</span>, you can take an entire [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]]. At the end of your turn, you will fall <span class="distance">100u</span> worth of distance. This is repeated until you have a turn where you are falling less than <span class="distance">100u</span>, at which point you will hit the ground and take 100 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid/Blunt Damage]]. A distance of <span class="distance">100u</span> is considered your terminal velocity, meaning you will never suffer more than 100 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid/Blunt Damage]] from a fall.

> [!note] Note: Fall damage is considered [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid/Blunt Damage]], as such, you can use your #Evasion to reduce fall damage.

Since a fall is resolved *on* your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]], there is a chance you can save other falling players by taking certain actions of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]]. If ever you wish to catch another character, each of you will take only half of the total fall damage, rounded down.

There are also many spells and some items, like the net, that can also help you catch, or slow down, a falling character.

## Traps
The world is a dangerous place. As you delve into dungeons and sneak through enemy camps, you will often run into **Traps** meant to ensnare and harm you.

When you have run into a **Trap**, there is a brief moment between when a **Trap** is triggered and when the trap closes.

When a character walks into a **Trap**, the character is considered triggered, but not yet closed. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]], or the player that laid the **Trap**, will describe the events unfolding as a trap is triggered. This will give clues as to what is about to happen and how it can be stopped.

##### Freeplay Traps
If the **Trap** is triggered during the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Freeplay\|Freeplay]] phase of the game, the character that triggered the trap will be [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Surprised\|Surprised]] for one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]], meaning they need to be saved by someone else if they wish to avoid the **Trap's** effects.

At the time the **Trap** is triggered, all allies within walking distance can make an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Edge Save]] (to see who has the best chance to try to save their friend.) The ally with the highest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Edge Save]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is given one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] to attempt a rescue. After that, the player with the second highest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is given a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] to help, but they have one stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Stunned\|Stunned]].

The simplest rescue you can perform is taking actions that will grant an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] to your ally on their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] for the **Trap**. You will need to justify how you have helped and describe what actions or spells you are using to provide that aid. You may need to roll for those actions, with a success being needed for your ally to gain an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]]. While helping at a distance is an easier and safer choice, more dangerous traps may still deal some damage to the target on a successful [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]], meaning that even with your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]], the target of the **Trap** may still suffer some ill effects.

Another way you can attempt a rescue is to try to push the target out of the way of the **Trap**. To push someone, use the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Grapple\|Grapple Ability]] to get them out of harm's way. If the target is willing, the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Grapple\|Grapple Ability]] can be an automatic [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]]. Note that the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Grapple\|Grapple Ability]] may result in you taking the target's place, meaning that you may end up being the new target of the **Trap**, provided that you do not have enough movement to get back out of the way.
<!--TODO: Make sure Grapple-push moves you to where they were-->

##### Encounter Traps
If the **Trap** is triggered during an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]], the target of the trap will not be [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Surprised\|Surprised]], and will be given an ultimatum of some kind. For [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] and #items, the ultimatums can be found in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] or #item description. As an example, the target may need to make a choice between stepping backward and giving up their remaining movement or take damage. If the target does not like either ultimatum, they can choose to immediately end their turn, delaying the closing of the **Trap** until the start of their next turn. This delays the **Trap's** effect, giving other characters a chance to save their friend on their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] (in ways similar to those mentioned [[#Freeplay Traps|above]].)
