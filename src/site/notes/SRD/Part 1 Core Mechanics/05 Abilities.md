During [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Freeplay\|Freeplay]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounters]], you will often rely on the various [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] listed on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]]. You can also improvise activities that are not official [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] and are not found on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]].

[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] on the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities\|Basic Ability List]] are available to all characters and will be discussed in more detail in chapter [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/07 Basic Abilities\|07 Basic Abilities]].

At the top of each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] you will find a header containing some or all of the following details that will serve as quick references:
* **Time.** (Referred to as the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]].) Defines how long the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] takes to start and take effect.
* **Target.** The qualifications of what can be targeted by the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].
* **Triggers.** Conditions that, when met, allow you to use the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]].
* **Requirements.** Conditions that must be met to start an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].
* **Components.** Conditions that should be met in order to easily start and maintain an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].
* **Test.** A summary of the type of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] you will need to make for the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].
* **Saves.** A summary of what types of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Saves]] your targets may need to make to avoid extra effects.
* **Effects.** A summary of what types of effects the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] will cause.
* **Duration.** A description of how long the effects can last for.

Following the header, you will find a full description of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] and its effects. Any header information with an asterisk will also be described in more detail in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] description.
## Ability Time
An [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]]" describes both when you can start the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] and how long it takes before the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] will take effect. (Note that this is different from [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Effect Duration\|Effect Duration]], which describes how long the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] *effect* can last.)

[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]] will matter less in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Freeplay\|Freeplay]], but when an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] begins, you will need to pay close attention to your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Times]], as they will determine if and when you can use each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].

There are seven [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Times]]: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Action\|Action]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Action\|Free Action]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Action]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Passive\|Passive]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episodic\|Episodic]].
###### Action
"**Action**" is the most common [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]].
You must spend a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] to start an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Action\|Action]]. Immediately after that, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is determined. Once the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is finalized, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] effect immediately becomes active.
###### Free Action
A "**Free Action**" can only be used on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]], but does not cost a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]]. Immediately after it has been started, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is determined and then it takes effect.

You can also improvise a handful of **Free Actions** to do things that would be easy to incorporate into your other actions on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]], like opening a door, dropping an item, or talking smack.
###### Slow Action
A "**Slow Action**" must be *started* on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] by spending a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] and choosing your targets. After that, you will need to wait until the start of your next [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] before you can perform the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] (if it needs one) and activate the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] effects.

In the time before your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Action]] can take effect, your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Action]] _can_ be interrupted. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Actions]] are generally stronger, so if an ally begins one, you may want to help protect them or keep enemies in the area of effect. Similarly, if an enemy uses a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Action]], you may want to try to get out of the way or interrupt it.

You must choose your target for the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] when the ability is _started_. That said, you _may_ choose targets that are initially invalid (due to being out or range, sight, etc.) as it is only when the time comes for the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] to take effect that the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] targets, [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Requirement\|Requirements]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Components]] will be evaluated. This means that a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Action]] can also be interrupted by interfering with its [[#Requirements]] and [[#Components]], which will be discussed later in this chapter.

> [!important] Important: Using [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] can interrupt your own [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Actions]].
> If a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Action]] targets an area, the area will not move if you move, but may instead be considered invalid if you move. For example, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Cone Shape\|Cone Shape]] and the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Line Shape\|Line Shape]] target the spot where you stand and emanate outward. Moving from that spot would invalidate that target area. Other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape\|Shapes]] instead target a point within a certain range. For those, so long as that point remains within range and targetable, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Action]] will not be interrupted.
###### Reaction
A "**Reaction**" is much quicker and takes but a moment to complete, provided that conditions are right.
[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reactions]] can be started at any point in a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]] immediately after its [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Trigger]] occurs. Starting a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] requires that you spend a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]]. Immediately after you start a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]], its [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is determined, then it takes effect.

If ever more than one character uses a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] for the same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Trigger]], the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reactions]] are resolved in the same order as the current [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn Order\|Turn Order]].

Only one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]] can be used per [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Trigger]] per [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Player]].
> [!important] Remember
> Using a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] in an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] uses up one of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beats]] for the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]], meaning it will not be available on your next [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]].
###### Free Reactions
[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reactions]] are the same as [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reactions]], but do not cost a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] to start.

Only one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]] can be used per [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Trigger]] per [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player\|Player]].
> [!note] Unlimited Free Reactions
> Unless the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] states otherwise, there is no limit to the number of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reactions]] that you can perform in a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]], provided that their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Triggers]] occur and you are only performing one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]] per [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Trigger]].

###### Passives
A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Passive\|Passive]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] does not need to be started and is always in effect. For example, the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Archetype Abilities/Rogue Abilities/Climber\|Climber Ability]] is a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Passive\|Passive]] that always provides you with the ability to [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Climb\|Climb]] a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Spitting Distance]].
<!--
### Longer Ability Times
Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] take even more time to execute. For those abilities, you will see their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]] listed as a number of minutes. For these [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] to take effect, you will need to sustain your efforts for the amount of time listed by using at least one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] per [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]] for that entire duration. If ever you are unable to use a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] to sustain the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]], it automatically fails. If the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] requires a roll, the roll is made only as a part of the last [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]]. As an example, an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that takes one minute would require 10 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Rounds]] (and 10 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beats]]), with the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] and effect occurring immediately after you spend your 10th [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]].

During [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Freeplay\|Freeplay]], this metric should be used more as a rough guideline for what may be possible. For example, you may find it difficult to perform a longer spell in the few moment before your boat crashes.

> [!tip] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] with an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]] slower than a few [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beats]] are generally not recommended for use in an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]] and should be saved for the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Freeplay\|Freeplay]] phase.
#### Rushing Abilities
Longer [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] can be "rushed." When you want to rush an ability, you can take a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] final [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] to cut its [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]] in half (rounding up in terms of number of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Rounds]].) This can be done as many times as you would like, provided that you are not at the maximum number of 3 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]]. As an example, an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that would normally take one minute (10 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Rounds]]) could take 30 seconds (5 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Rounds]]) if rushed. If a second [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] was still possible, that time could further be cut down to 15 seconds (3 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Rounds]].)
#### Passive Abilities
A few rare [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] will be listed as "**Passive**" instead of having an [[#Ability Time]]. **Passive Abilities** are always in effect, and primarily grant access to several other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]].
-->

#### Episodics
**Episodic Abilities** work a bit different than others. All **Episodic** [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] are performed at the start of a new [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]]. These [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] often include effects like granting you points that you can spend later in an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]] or grant you visions of things to come. Anything gained from an **Episodic Ability** will be lost at the end of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]], so you will want to be sure to use it while you have it.

> [!eg] Example: Episode Abilities
> #David has the 'Visions' [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episodic\|Episodic]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].
> * A new [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]] is starting. #David uses his 'Visions' [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episodic\|Episodic]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].
> * #David rolls a 10, granting him a vague vision of a danger to come in this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]].


## Targets
Each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] will lay out what targets are valid for that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. This will often include the types of creatures you can affect along with a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distance]] at which you can affect said targets.

### Creature Tags
Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] will only affect certain types of creatures. This is indicated using [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Creature Tags\|Creature Tags]] like [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Creature Tags/Undead\|Undead]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Creature Tags/Construct\|Construct]].

### Distances
In [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Kleptonomicon\|The Kleptonomicon]], a set of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Theater of the Mind\|Theater of the Mind]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distance]] are used. There are 5 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distances]] used by [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] for describing what targets can be hit. If those distances are prefixed with the word '**True**', then you do not need to be able to see the target and that target cannot benefit from taking cover.

Below are some examples of the 5 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distances]]:
* Targets in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] are close enough for melee combat. This includes martial arts, swordplay, etc.
* Targets in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Spitting Distance]] are close enough to spit on, splash with a potion, or spray with a spell that shoots out a wave of fire.
* Targets in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Throwing Distance]] are close enough to effectively throw darts, rocks, spears, or magical bolts.
* Targets in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Shooting Distance]] are in range of bows, crossbows, slings, and longer range magical attacks.
* Targets in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Sniping Distance]] are only in range of longbows and the most distant of magical effects.

If you would rather play with more exact map measurements, the following conversion chart can be used to convert the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Theater of the Mind\|Theater of the Mind]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distances]] to square units used by many other tabletop games:

| [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] | [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Spitting Distance]] | [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Throwing Distance]] | [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Shooting Distance]] | [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Sniping Distance]] |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1                               | 4                               | 8                               | 16                              | 200                            |
### Shapes
[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] may be able to affect many creatures or objects in an area. Such [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] will target an area known as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape\|Shape]] instead of directly targeting creatures or objects.

Every [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape\|Shape]] will have a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Shape Origin]]. This serves as the actual target of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] and the point from which the effects will flow outward in straight lines. This flow is easily blocked by objects, unless the shape is described as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/True Shape\|True Shape]]. Anything touching a portion of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape\|Shape]] to which the effect can flow can be affected by the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].

A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape\|Shape's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Origin]] and orientation must be specified when you *start* an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. Because of this, the creatures within the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape\|Shape]] may have a chance to escape to safety outside of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape\|Shape]] if it has a slower [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]] and you have no one there to help you keep the potential targets in range.

Below is a detailed description of each of the five [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape\|Shapes]]:
###### Cone Shape
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Cone Shape\|Cone Shape's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Origin]] is located where you are and extends outward from you. The cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Origin]]. The cone's length will be a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distance]] provided by the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. The cone's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Origin]] is not included in the shape, unless you decide otherwise.
###### Cube Shape
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Cube Shape\|Cube Shape's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Origin]] lies anywhere on a face of the cubic area. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Shape Origin]] must be within the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distance]] described by the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. The cube's size will be expressed as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distance]] in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that is equal to length of each side. A cube's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Origin]] is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
###### Cylinder Shape
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Cylinder Shape\|Cylinder Shape's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Origin]] is the center of a circle. The circle's radius will be given as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distance]] in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Origin]] to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distance]] described in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] as the height of the cylinder. A cylinder's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Origin]] is included in the cylinder's area of effect.
###### Line Shape
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Line Shape\|Line Shape's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Origin]] is placed at your location and extends in a straight line outward a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distance]] provided by the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. A line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
###### Sphere
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sphere Shape\|Sphere Shape's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shape Origin\|Origin]] is a point you choose within a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distance]] specified by the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. The sphere extends outward from that point by a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distance]] also provided by the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. A sphere's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.

## Triggers
**Triggers**, or "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Triggers]]," are only used by [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] with an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]] of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]]. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Triggers]] describe the events that will allow you to start a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. Unless the described [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Trigger]] arises, you will be unable to use the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].

Many [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Triggers]] will note that they trigger when a creature "starts an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]". In these cases you will be able to use your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] after the triggering [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] has been started and its targets chosen, but before its [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] is performed and its effects become active. This is a powerful way to affect the actions of others, possibly interrupting them.
## Requirements
From the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary\|Glossary]]:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] will list **Requirements**. **Requirements** can be generic things like “hands” or “standing,” or **Requirements** can be a specific type of point that you must spend from one of the #point_banks on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] (Note: Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]] are #point_banks. You may also have #point_banks unique to your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]] or #constitution.)

An [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] with **Requirements** will instantly be considered a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Fail]] if you are lacking a Requirement at any point between the start of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] and when the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] and effect are determined. If points are **Required**, those points are only deducted at the time of determining the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] (but they must be available from the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] start to its scoring.)


</div></div>


## Components
Some abilities may also list **Components**, which are similar to [[#Requirements]], but they must remain unbroken during your entire [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Effect Duration\|Effect Duration]], or you will need to re-roll the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]'s [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Skill\|Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]], or the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]'s effects will end early.

From the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary\|Glossary]]:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] will list [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Components]] needed by the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Components]] can be generic things like “hands” or “standing,” or a specific type of point you must spend from one of the #point_banks on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] (Note: Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]] are #point_banks. You may also have #point_banks unique to your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]] or #constitution.) If points are listed, then you must spend that many points before the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] can be rolled for.

If you are lacking a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Component]] when it comes time to roll the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Skill\|Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]], you will receive a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] for every missing [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Component]]. Note that that means that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] with an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]] greater than one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] will only need to meet their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Components]] when spending the final [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] needed to fulfill the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]]. This includes [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Actions]].

Unlike [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Requirement\|Requirements]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Components]] also need to remain unaffected for the entire [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Effect Duration\|Effect Duration]] as well. If a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Component]] is interrupted at any point during your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Effect Duration\|Effect Duration]], you will need to re-roll the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Skill\|Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] and get a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]] or the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] effects will immediately end. This [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] is performed for each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Component]] that was interrupted.

If one of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Components]] is a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Point Bank\|Point Bank]], that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Point Bank\|Point Bank]] gains a soft lock (often tracked with a small token.) If that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Point Bank\|Point Bank]] changes, up or down, that change counts as an interruption of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Component]].

It is worth noting that the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Component]] '[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Concentration\|Concentration]]' adds a second layer of difficulty. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Concentration\|Concentration]] imposes a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] to an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] initial [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Skill\|Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] for each other active [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Concentration\|Concentration]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].

</div></div>


Any listed **Components** will be needed for both the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]] and the entire [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Effect Duration\|Effect Duration]] to maintain the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]]  effect, but lacking a **Component**, or having it interrupted or broken, will not mean automatic failure.

**Components** will first list one of the three [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Saves]], followed by generic things like “hands” or “standing,” or a specific #point_bank on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] (like your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]], or a #point_bank unique to your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]] or #constitution.) If a #point_bank is listed, that #point_bank is "locked" and cannot be altered, up _or_ down, without potentially causing your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] to fail.

If you find yourself lacking a **Component** at some point during your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]], you must roll the final [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] with a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] for every **Component** that is missing. If the number of missing **Components** takes you beyond the maximum number of 3 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]] for a roll, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] gets an automatic [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Low Score]].

Similarly, if ever a **Component** is affected in some way _during_ the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Effect Duration\|Effect Duration]], you will need to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Pass]] the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]] or the effect will immediately end. If more than one **Component** is affected, you will roll the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]] with a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] for every **Component** affected beyond the first.

### Concentration
Many spells will note **Concentration** as a [[#Component]]. For each **Concentration** [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that is active beyond the first, you will gain a stack of the #concentrating [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]]. This [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]] adds an additional [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Saves]] for **Concentration** [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], making it harder to maintain more than one at once.

Abilities that have a **Concentration** [[#Component]] also implicitly have a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]] [[#Component]], meaning you will need to make a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]] if ever you take damage or are healed in a way that effects those specific #point_banks.

## Ability Tests
A majority of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] will describe a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] that needs to be performed. The resulting [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] from that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] will affect what effects become active.

The most common [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] will use one of the three [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype Stat\|Archetype Stats]]: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fighter Stat\|Fighter Stat]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Rogue Stat\|Rogue Stat]], or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Mage Stat\|Mage Stat]]. That said, an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] can list any [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] from your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]].

Whichever [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] is listed, you will need to find that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] and apply it when making the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] to determine your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] for that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. To see what effect each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Score Range]] has on the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]], look for the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Score Range]] shorthand in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] description.

Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] will also be affected by situational [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Bonus\|Bonuses]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalties]]. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Bonus\|Bonuses]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalties]] will be discussed more later in this chapter in the section on [[#Bonuses and Penalties]].

Occasionally, you will see an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that has no [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] listed (and no [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Score Ranges]] in its description.) For these [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] you will not need to make a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] at all, as it automatically gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]] and the effects described are the ones that will become active. A few rare effects can still cause you to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Fail]] these automatic [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]]. In those cases, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] will have no effect.

## Ability Saves
[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] that list a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]] will require that the targets of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] perform a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. Most often this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] will be performed using one of the target's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Saves]]. In the description of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] you will find a description of what happens when a target [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Passes]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Fails]] the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].

All [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Saves]] are affected by the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] you get on the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] in the following ways:
- \[0!\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Failure]]. The target automatically [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Passes]] their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]].
- \[..6\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Low]]. The target gets an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] on their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]].
- \[7..9\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed]]. The target makes their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]] with no extra modifications.
- \[10..\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|High]]. The target must make their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]] with a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]].
- \[10!\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Success]]. The target automatically [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Fails]] their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]].
## Ability Effects
The header's description of an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] effects is mostly there for quick reference, but may be used when describing [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Triggers]] or other components of the game. For example, if a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction Trigger\|Reaction Trigger]] were to stat "When a creature uses a Healing Effect [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]," then that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] could be used whenever a creature uses an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that lists "Healing" in its effects header.
## Ability Duration
<!--TODO: I think we've gotten rid of most of these and its just "forever" or "instant"...-->
While most [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] effects are instantaneous and then abate, some can last for longer stretches of time. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]]  that note an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Effect Duration\|Effect Duration]] can have their effects last up to that amount of time. These longer effects remain active for the entire [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Effect Duration\|Duration]] listed. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Effect Duration\|Effect Durations]] are usually listed in terms of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Rounds]]. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]], in terms of an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Effect Duration\|Effect Duration]], will always ends at the *start* of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] on which it began.

If an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Effect Duration\|Effect Duration]] is not listed, the duration is negligible and any effects end right after they begin.
###### Ending Triggers
Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Effect Duration\|Effect Durations]] may end earlier than their listed time if certain events occur. Unless stated otherwise, you can also end any effect early if it was created by you and you spend a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] to do so.

As discussed earlier in this chapter, an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] may also end early if any of its [[#Components]] are affected.

## Flavors
When you take a new [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that has a list of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Flavor\|Flavors]] to choose from, you must choose your starting [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Flavor\|Flavor]] at the time of gaining the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Flavor\|Flavor]] that you chose will then remain fixed for the entire life of that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Flavor\|Flavors]] often change the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Damage Type]] of an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] or what [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Saves]] it can impose on your targets.

## Bonuses and Penalties
An [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] will often list [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Bonus\|Bonuses]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalties]] that will change either the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] or the effects of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].

Each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalty]] will describe a condition that, when met, means you must apply that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalty's]] effect. Each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Bonus\|Bonus]] works in the same way except you can choose to skip it (unless it states otherwise.)

There are many [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Bonus\|Bonuses]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalties]] that will simply apply an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]], respectively, to the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. This should be resolved during the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] before any of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability's]] effects have been applied.

There are three [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalties]] that are more common than any others. They each impose stacks of a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]], which in-turn will impose [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]] on future tests for the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] with that same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalty]]. From the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary\|Glossary]]:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] with the "**Straining**" [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalty]] (or "**Straining** [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]]") impose one stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Strained\|Strained]] if you [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Pass]] their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].

All future **Straining** [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] have one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] for each stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Strained\|Strained]] that you have.


</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] with the "**Exhausting**" [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalty]] (or "**Exhausting** [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]]") impose one stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Exhausted\|Exhausted]] if you [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Pass]] their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].

All future **Exhausting** [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] have one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] for each stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Exhausted\|Exhausted]] that you have.


</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] with the "**Concentration**" [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalty]] (or "**Concentration** [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]]") impose one stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Concentrating\|Concentrating]] when they take effect and remove one stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Concentrating\|Concentrating]] when that effect ends.

All [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Focus Saves]] and **Concentration** [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] have one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] for each stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Concentrating\|Concentrating]] that you have. If you [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Fail]] such a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]], all active **Concentration** [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] effects end.

If ever a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Component\|Component]] of a **Concentration** [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] is affected, you must make a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Focus Save]].


<!--Do we need 'Duration' and 'Components' if they're all the same?-->


</div></div>


[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]] will be discussed further in [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet\|Part 2]] [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet/05 Status Conditions and Saving Throws\|05 Status Conditions and Saving Throws]].

> [!eg] #Alice uses a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Concentration\|Concentration]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]
> * #Alice uses the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Spell Abilities/Illusion\|Illusion]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Spell Ability\|Spell Ability]] that has the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Concentration\|Concentration]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalty]].
> * #Alice performs her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] for the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] and gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|High Score]]. #Alice creates an illusory image of a book on the altar. This active effect imposes a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Concentrating\|Concentrating]] on #Alice.
> * #Alice attempts to use [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Spell Abilities/Illusion\|Illusion]] again to try to create spooky whispers coming from the book. This time #Alice must make the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] with a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]], since she has a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Concentrating\|Concentrating]]. #Alice gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Low Score]], forcing all of her active [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Concentration\|Concentration]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] effects to end, making her illusory book disappear. On a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Low Score]], [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Spell Abilities/Illusion\|Illusion]] still takes effect, so the whispers begin to chant in the empty spot where the illusory book used to be.
> * #Alice is out of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beats]] and ends her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]].

## Upgrades
**Upgrades** will be described more in [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet\|Part 2]] in the chapter [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet/08 Tracker Boxes\|08 Tracker Boxes]]. In short, gaining an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Upgrade\|Upgrade]] permanently improves an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]], often making it deal more [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage\|Damage]] or have less restrictions and stipulations.

## Prepared Abilities
Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], when used, will "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Prepare\|Prepare]]" a different [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] so it can be used. For example an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]  may "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Prepare\|Prepare]] a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]]" or "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Prepare\|Prepare]] a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]]" etc. When this happens, you get to add [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Prepare\|Prepared]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] to your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] for a limited time.

Each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Prepare\|Prepared]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] will stipulate a different case for when it expires (a.k.a. when it is once again removed from your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]].) For example, if a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Prepare\|Prepared]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]]  "expires after one use," then it can only be used *once*, becoming unavailable again immediately after its use. The most common expiration descriptions include expiring after a certain span of time or if you lose [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Concentration\|Concentration]] on an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].

## Glyphic Spell Ability Rules
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyphic Spell\|Glyphic Spells]] are often used to create security systems and magical mechanisms. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyphic Spell\|Glyphic Spells]] rely on shared sets of rules that allow them to be connected together to form complex networks of magical machinery.

Learning the shared **Glyphic Spell Rules** will help you interact with security systems, avoid traps, and possibly even create a few [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyphs]] combos of your own.

Unless otherwise stated, all [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyphs]] created by [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyphic Spell\|Glyphic Spells]] have the following shared rules:
* A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyphic Spell\|Glyphic Spell]] creates a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyph]] that appears as a rune, set of runes, sigil, or magic circle that is [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Invisible\|Invisible]].
* [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyphs]] do not have a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] of their own during an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]], but have one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] per [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]] that can be used to perform [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reactions]]. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyphs]] can also use certain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reactions]]. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyph's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] is reset at the start of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn Order\|Turn Order]] for a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]].
* Each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyphic Spell\|Glyphic Spell]] has a set of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Ability\|Glyph Abilities]] that can be given to the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyph]] at the time of casting. For every [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Ability\|Glyph Ability]] added beyond the first, you will need to extend the casting time by spending an additional [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Beat\|Beat]] per [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Ability\|Glyph Ability]]. Possible [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Ability\|Glyph Abilities]] are described by each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyphic Spell\|Glyphic Spell]]. Unless otherwise stated, the same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Ability\|Glyph Ability]] *can* be added more than once, provided that you specify different details each time. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Ability\|Glyph Abilities]] cannot be altered or changed _after_ you have finished casting a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyph]].
* When starting a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Ability\|Glyph Ability]], you can specify that a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyph]] should be connected to any other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyph]] within [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] of it. Many [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Ability\|Glyph Abilities]] can send out a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Command\|Glyph Command]] as a part of its effects. When a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyph]] is about to send out a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Command\|Glyph Command]], it shines with visible light for just a moment (of a color of the creator's choice.) At the start of the next [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]] (or 6 secs later) all connected [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyphs]], and the glyph itself, will receive the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Command\|Glyph Command]] which may trigger their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Ability\|Glyph Abilities]]. Note that that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Ability\|Glyph Ability]] may issue its own [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Command\|Glyph Command]], creating a slow chain reaction that moves along the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyphs]] at a rate of one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyph]] per [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]]. A skilled [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyph]] hacker may be able to figure out what [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Command\|Glyph Commands]] are being used by a network of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyphs]] and possibly even twist the network to do their bidding.
* Often, [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyphs]] will be attached to surfaces. If two connected [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyphs]] are ever moved more than a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Spitting Distance]] apart, their connection is permanently broken.
* All [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyphs]] can have the following [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Ability\|Glyph Abilities]] in addition to any described in their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Ability\|Glyph Ability]] description:
> [!free-reaction] Dismiss
> [Time:: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]]] [Target:: Self]
> [Trigger:: Upon receiving a predefined [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Command\|Glyph Command]]]
> 
> Permanently dismiss this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyph]].

> [!free-reaction] Deactivate
> [Time:: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]]] [Target:: Self]
> [Trigger:: Upon receiving a predefined [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph Command\|Glyph Command]]]
> 
> Temporarily disable this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Glyph\|Glyph]] for a specified amount of time.

<!--TODO: Make sure Minor Illusion or something covers these:%%
>  * Upon creation or upon receiving a specific **Command**, the emitter can issue forth sound. The sound's volume can range from a whisper to a scream (from **Quiet** up to **Loud**.) The noise emitted can be your voice, someone else's voice, beating drums, animals roaring, or any other sound you choose. An ambient or repeating sound can continue unabated for as long as you'd like, or a more unique sequence can be specified that lasts up to 10 minutes before terminating or repeating. If the sound issued is a message, it can only contain up to 25 words. The words can be paced however you'd like over the 10 minute timespan.
