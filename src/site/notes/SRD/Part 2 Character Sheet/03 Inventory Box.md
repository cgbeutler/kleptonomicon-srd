> [!quote-r] "No adventurer worth their salt would ever leave home without an enchanted pack of some kind. Our packs boast more storage and quicker retrieval than any of our competitors."
> \- Betty Guilding

Magically enchanted backpacks are ubiquitous in the world of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Kleptonomica\|Kleptonomica]]. Packs often contains magic lashes for quick weapon storage and retrieval. Enchanted pouches can also help to store and retrieve items in the heat of the moment. The packs also allow for miraculous amounts of storage, making encumbrance a thing of the past.

When you come to possess new [[#Items]], you add them to the **Inventory Box**, along with any useful notes about them, like value, uses remaining, and what effects the item has.

Managing items could get tedious if you were to loot every room. To help with this, your character also has a more abstract store of loot. This is represented in two parts: [[#Wealth Skills]] and [[#Good]]. Both the [[#Wealth Skills]] and the [[#Goods]] are divided across four [[#Wealth Types]] that allow you to improvise and actualize items long after you have looted a room. Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skill]] and [[#Goods]] can also be found in the **Inventory Box**.

![P1 InventoryBox.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/P1%20InventoryBox.png)

## Wealth
Your **Wealth** is an abstract representation of both your [[#Wealth Skills]], in each a [[#Wealth Category]], and your current [[#Goods]] in each [[#Wealth Category]]. Below is an example view of the **Wealth** table from #Alice's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]]:

![[Alice - WealthGrid.png\|Alice - WealthGrid.png]]

#### Wealth Categories
There are four [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Categories]] that each represent different areas of the economy. Each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Player Character\|Player Character]] will have their own balance of these categories that will change what [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]] they can find in the world and barter for in cities.
###### General Wealth
* Widely available items.
* Food, first aid, many raw materials, common tools, household objects, standard weapons and armor, etc.
###### Grey Wealth
* Illicit and specialty goods.
* Tool kits and traps.
* Poisons, lockpicks, climbing gear, forgery kits, ball-bearings, caltrops, bear traps, etc.
###### Obscure Wealth
* Magical ingredients and gear that are rare and difficult to handle and work with.
* Magic scrolls, mana potions, eyes of newt, phoenix feathers, crystal balls, pendulums, dousing rods, hag stones, etc.
###### Fine Wealth
* Highly valuable materials and powerful magic items.
* Diamonds, pearls, gold nuggets, enchanted weapons, cloaks of night, etc.

#### Wealth Skills
Your four [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skills]] are [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifiers]] representing how skilled you are in noticing, appraising, recovering, and trading [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]] in a given [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]].

All [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skills]] start at 1. Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skills]] are improved as you [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level Up]] and gain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perks]]. Each improvement makes it easier to get better [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]]. Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fine Wealth Skill\|Fine Wealth Skill]] may also increase upon gaining important social connections or reaching a level of particular influence in the community.

> [!gm]- [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] Note: Fine Wealth Skill Improvements
> Over the course of the game, you should give out two [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fine Wealth Skill\|Fine Wealth Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Improvement\|Improvements]]. You should try to grant these [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fine Wealth Skill\|Fine Wealth Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Improvement\|Improvements]] as a result of players gaining new important connections and becoming more influential in the community.
> 
> If players were to ever destroy those connections or tarnish their reputation, it may make sense to remove the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Improvement\|Improvement]] as a way to reflect that change.

#### Goods
The bubbles below each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skill]] are used to document your current [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Goods]] of that given type. These [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Goods]] abstractly represent the overall loot you have gathered on your journey. You have four [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Goods]] values: one for each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]].

You will most often gain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Goods]] from the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Investigate\|Investigate Ability]] and the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] as a reward for exploring and succeeding in combat.

All [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Goods]] start at 0 and have a max of 10. Once you have hit the maximum, your magic pack will be unable to carry any more. At that point you will want to use it or trade it for a different type.

### Using Wealth
The most common way you will use your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skills]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Goods]] are when using the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Item Search\|Inventory Search Ability]].

To use the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Item Search\|Inventory Search Ability]], you will first choose an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] from the [[SRD/Appendix/Items\|Item List]] that you hope to gain explicitly in your inventory. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] you chose will list a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]] associated with it. You will need to spend 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Good]] of that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]], then roll your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skill]] for that same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]] to determine your [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Item Search\|Item Search]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]]. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] you get will determine if you gain the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] as well as what quality the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] is when you do gain it.

If ever an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] lists more than one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]], you can choose which [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]] to pull from, but the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skill]] that you roll must match the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Good]] spent.
###### Improvised Items
At times, you will want to search for generic items that are not found in the [[SRD/Appendix/Items\|Item List]], like a bar of soap or a candlestick. For these items, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will determine how common the item is and what [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]] the item may fit into. You will then roll the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Item Search\|Inventory Search Ability]] as normal using the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]] chosen. If you [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Fail]] to get a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] that matches the rarity of the item, you may not get the item or get a flawed version of the item, like a fraying rope or a nearly-spent candle. To help with identifying the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] needed for improvised items, the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Item Search\|Inventory Search Ability]] lists some examples for the different [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Categories]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Score Ranges]].

Below is the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Item Search\|Inventory Search Ability]] as found in the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities\|Basic Ability List]] appendix:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




[Time:: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Action\|Action]]] [Target:: Your own pack]
[Requirements:: 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Good]], access to your pack]
[Test:: The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skill]] of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] being searched for]
[Effect:: Gain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]]]

Choose an item you want from the [[SRD/Appendix/Items\|Item List]] in the appendix. Spend 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Good]] from the item's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]], then roll a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] using that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]]'s [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skill]] as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]].

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] you chose will either specify a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] that you need to roll to get that item or a set of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Score Ranges]] along with perks or flaws that come along with each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Score Range]].

**[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Bonus\|Bonuses]]:**
* **Boosting.** *After* you [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Fail]] the roll, you can spend 1 additional [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Good]] of the same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]] to gain an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] on the roll (up to the max of 3 retries) potentially avoiding a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Fail]].
* **Multipack.** Gain an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] if the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] you are searching for has the [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Consumed\|Consumed]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Tag\|Item Tag]] and you have used that same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] at some point before.
* **Treasure.** When actualizing #general, #grey, or #Obscure items, you can instead spend from your #fine [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Goods]]. Doing so allows you to add your #fine [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skill]] *and* the item's normal [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skill]] to the roll, improving your chances of getting that item. The item you get will look nicer, being made of gold, bejeweled, etc.
#### Improvised Items
You can improvise items not found in the [[SRD/Appendix/Items\|Item List]], but that would be reasonably found in the world. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will offer you a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] that you then need to reach for that item. Falling short of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] for that item will result in not having that item or having a flawed, poor quality version of that item (like a fraying rope or a rusted sword.) Below are example improvised items for each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Score Range]]:
* General Wealth
	* \[..6] F Tier: Raw Materials & simple items: Bell, Candle, Raw Food, Hammer, Knife, Oil, Soap, String(10 ft), Water, Writing Supplies.
	* \[7..9] C Tier: Common Manufactured Items: Commoner Foods, Compass, Crowbar, Lantern, Pickaxe, Sledge, Rope(50 ft), Tongs.
	* \[10..] A Tier: Standard Shields, Armor, Weapons, Better Foods.
* Grey Wealth
	* \[7..9] C Tier: Basic Traps & Hobbyist Tools/Kits: Climbing Kit, Lock-picks, Scalpel.
	* \[10..] A Tier: Advanced Traps & Artisan Tools/Kits: Forger Kit, Jeweler Kit, Leatherwork Kit.
* Obscure Wealth
	* \[7..9] C Tier: Strange Ingredients & Basic Magic Tools: Dowsing Rod, Eye of Newt, Pendulum.
	* \[10..] A Tier: More Rare Ingredients & Magic Tools: Crystal Ball, Dragon's scale, Void Crystals.
* Spend Fine Wealth
	* Any of the above: Will be higher quality, made of materials like gold, or come in a greater quantity.

> [!example]- Examples
> 
> #Alice needs a **Spell Scroll (Better)** in order to cast a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Spell Ability\|Spell Ability]] she does not know:
> * #Alice looks up the **Spell Scroll (Better)** item in the **Item** appendix (or using the helpful cheat-sheet on her **Character Sheet**.) She finds that the scroll is in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Obscure Good\|Obscure]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]].
> * #Alice spends 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Obscure Good\|Obscure Good]] and rolls a `d10`, adding to it her `+1` [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Obscure Wealth Skill\|Obscure Wealth Skill]]. #Alice gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] of `9`.
> * Since #Alice's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] is below the `10` that she needs to get the item, #Alice decides to spend another of her [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Obscure Good\|Obscure Goods]] to roll with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]]. This time #Alice gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] of `12`, which is enough to get the item.
> * #Alice adds the **Spell Scroll (Better)** to her inventory. #Alice can now use that scroll to cast the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Spell Ability\|Spell Ability]] she did not know.
> 
> #Bob needs a **First Aid Kit (Better)** to prepare for a battle to come:
> * #Bob looks up the **First Aid Kit** in the **Item** appendix (or using the helpful cheat-sheet on her **Character Sheet**.) He finds that it is in the "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/General Good\|General]]" [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Category\|Wealth Category]].
> * #Bob spends 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/General Good\|General Good]] and rolls a d10, adding to it his `+2` [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/General Wealth Skill\|General Wealth Skill]]. #Bob gets a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] of `8`.
> * #Bob does not have any more [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Goods]] to spare. #Bob elects to take the weaker **First Aid Kit (Common)** instead, adding it to his inventory.

###### Bartering
If ever you find your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Goods]] getting out-of-balance with one another, you can always find a marketplace and perform the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Item Trade\|Inventory Barter Ability]] to re-balance your pack or sell old items you don't need anymore:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




[Time:: 10 min] [Target:: A marketplace]
[Requirements:: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Goods]]]

Choose one of the following:
* **Trade in Bulk.**
  You may exchange at a rate of 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/General Good\|General]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Grey Good\|Grey]], or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Obscure Good\|Obscure Good]] for 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/General Good\|General]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Grey Good\|Grey]], or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Obscure Good\|Obscure Good]].
* **Trade in Finery.**
  You may exchange at a rate of 5 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/General Good\|General]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Grey Good\|Grey]], and/or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Obscure Good\|Obscure Goods]] for 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fine Good\|Fine Good]] (or vise-versa.)


</div></div>


## Items
Most of the items you will need to use throughout the game can be found in the following appendices:
* [[SRD/Appendix/Items\|Item List]]: A list of items that you will use more often. These often help solve problems and survive in encounters. The [[SRD/Appendix/Items\|Item List]] contains things like [[SRD/Appendix/Items/General Items/First Aid Kit\|First Aid Kits]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Items/Obscure Items/Spell Scroll\|Spell Scrolls]]. <!--TODO: Add 'FINE' examples too-->
* [[SRD/Appendix/Items/Special Items/Special Item List\|Special Item List]]: A list of special and unique items for [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GMs]] to hand out. Players cannot generally get these in any way other than finding them during their adventures.

##### Item Grades
Many [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]] in the [[SRD/Appendix/Items\|Item List]] appendix list a set of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Scores]] that will determine what [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Grade\|Item Grade]] you get from the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Item Search\|Inventory Search Ability]]. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Grade\|Item Grade]] represents the quality and condition of the item.

[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Score Ranges]] and their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Grade\|Item Grades]]:
* \[..6\] (**F**)lawed Items
* \[7..9\] (**C**)ommon Items
* \[10..\] (**A**)wesome Items
* \[10!\] (**S**)uperior Items

Note that higher [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Grade\|Item Grades]] are harder to get, but any item that has a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] of an 'A' or higher can be sold back into points when you wish to get rid of it.

> [!gm] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] Note: Giving out Magic Items
> As you occasionally give out items, be sure to include [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]] of a lower [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]]. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Grade\|Flawed Grade]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]], like the lowest tier of the [[SRD/Appendix/Items/Fine Items/Wand of Teleportation\|Wand of Teleportation]] can add a lot of flavor and to the story and force players to think more before using their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]].

There are also items on the [[SRD/Appendix/Items/Special Items/Special Item List\|Special Item List]] that are only given out by the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] and cannot be rolled for. These are divided into two levels:
* SS - Super Special Items
* SSS - Singularly Super Special Items

> [!gm]- [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] Note: Special Item List
> The [[SRD/Appendix/Items/Special Items\|Special Item List]] is reserved as rewards that only you can hand out. Below is the recommended schedule for when to hand out these special rewards:
> * By Level 5: One SS Item per player.
> * By Level 10: Two SS Items per player.
> * By Level 15: Three SS Items and one SSS Item per player.
> 
> Try to give items that complement each character and accentuate their core goals and playstyles.

###### Selling Items
[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Grade\|Item Grade]] also comes into play when trying to sell an item using the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Item Sell\|Inventory Sell Ability]]:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




[Time:: 10 min] [Target:: A marketplace]
[Requirements:: 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]]]
[Test:: Required [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skill]]]

Remove the required [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] chosen from your inventory, then roll the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wealth Skill\|Wealth Skill]] associated with that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|item]]:
* \[..6\] No effect. *You had to give it up for next to nothing.*
* \[7..9\] You gain half of a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Good]] of the same type as the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]].
* \[8..10\] You gain 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Good]] of the same type as the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]].
* \[10!\] You gain 2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Good\|Goods]] of the same type as the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]].

[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalties]]:
* **Common.** Gain 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] if the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] is [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Grade\|Common Grade]].
* **Faulty.** Gain 2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]] if the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] is [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Grade\|Faulty Grade]].


</div></div>


As you can see, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalties]] for the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] causes you to have to roll with a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] for each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Grade\|Item Grade]] that the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] is below [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Grade\|Awesome Grade]].
##### Item Example
Below is an example of an **Item Block** and the details you can expect to find in the [[SRD/Appendix/Items\|Item List]]:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




[Type:: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/General Good\|General Good]]]
[Tags:: [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Consumed\|Consumed]], Healing]

> *A small pack of emergency medical supplies.*

Gain the following [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]:
> [!slow-action] Use First Aid Kit
> [Time:: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Action]]] [Target:: Self or Willing Creature in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] that is not a construct or undead]
> [Requirements:: 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Items/General Items/First Aid Kit\|First Aid Kit]]]
> [Test:: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Skill\|Tinkering Skill]]]
> [Effect:: Healing]
> 
> [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Skill\|Tinkering]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]]:
> * \[..6\] Restore 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Recovery\|Recovery]] to target creature.
> * \[7..\] Restore 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Recovery\|Recovery]] to target creature and the creature can immediately use a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] to use the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Recovery\|Recoveries]] gained to restore `1d10` [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]] or 1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]].

[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Grade\|Item Grades]]:
* \[..6\] You gain no item.
* \[7..\] C: The target regains an additional [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Recovery\|Recovery]] (2 total) and can possibly use both.
* \[10..\] A: The target regains two additional [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Recovery\|Recoveries]] (4 total) and can possibly use them all.
* \[10!\] S: The target instead regains all [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Recovery\|Recoveries]] and can possibly use them all.


</div></div>


The first lines within the item block is a summary containing the item's [[#Wealth Category]], [[#Item Type]], and a summary effect.

Just after the first line, you may find a visual description of the item. This flavor text is a suggestion that helps add consistent, descriptive flair to your game.

After the visual description box is the item's mechanical description. Here you will find a full description of how the item works. This description is often accompanied by an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that you can perform with that item.

##### Item Tags
Items will often list [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Tag\|Item Tags]] at the top of their item block. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Tag\|Item Tags]] help identify common rules that that item must abide by. Below are some of the most common [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Tag\|Item Tags]] to be aware of:
* **[[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Jealous\|Jealous]].** The item can become "jealous" of other items that have this same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Tag\|Item Tag]]. (More on this below. See [[#Item Jealousy]].)
* **[[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Consumed\|Consumed]].** The item can only be used once. These items usually have stronger effects. Don't be afraid to use these items, as the '**Multipack**' [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Bonus\|Bonus]] on the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Item Search\|Inventory Search Ability]] can give you [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] when trying to find [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Consumed\|Consumed]] items again if you have used them once before.
* **[[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Wield\|Wield]].** Once an item with this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item Tag\|Item Tag]] has been used, you cannot use any other [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Wield\|Wield]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]] for the rest of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Round\|Round]] and will drop the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] if anyone inflicts the [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Unarmed\|Unarmed Condition]] on you during that time. If you choose to drop the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Action\|Free Action]], you can use another [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Wield\|Wield]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]].

### Item Jealousy
Some items don't work well together. In the case of magical [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]], they often grow attached to their user and can become "Jealous" if you use other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]] instead of them.

To represent this relationship, you will start with a number of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Friendship Point\|Friendship Points]] equal to your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fine Wealth Skill\|Fine Wealth Skill]]. Whenever you improve your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fine Wealth Skill\|Fine Wealth Skill]], you will gain another [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Friendship Point\|Friendship Point]] to use.

Whenever you use an item with the [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Jealous\|Jealous Tag]], you will have to make any [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] with 2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]]. If you get a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Passing Score]] on any [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] with a [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Jealous\|Jealous]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]], you then must place one of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Friendship Point\|Friendship Points]] onto that item, unless the item already has 2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Friendship Point\|Friendship Points]]. For each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Friendship Point\|Friendship Point]] on an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]], you can ignore one of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]] for that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]]. As you foster your bond with your items, you will ensure that future [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] with those [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]] are more likely to succeed. Be careful when using multiple [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Jealous\|Jealous]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]], though. If you have no free [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Friendship Point\|Friendship Points]], a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Passing Score]] will force you to take a point from one of your other [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Jealous\|Jealous]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]].
###### Previous Owners
If a [[SRD/Appendix/Tags/Item Tags/Jealous\|Jealous]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]] had a previous owner, it may come with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Friendship Point\|Friendship Points]] from that owner. When using such an item, you will have the usual 2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantages]], but getting a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Passing Score]] will instead remove one of the previous owner's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Friendship Point\|Friendship Points]] instead of assigning one of yours. It won't be until you clear all of the previous owner's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Friendship Point\|Friendship Points]] that you will be required to assign one of your own [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Friendship Point\|Friendship Points]].
