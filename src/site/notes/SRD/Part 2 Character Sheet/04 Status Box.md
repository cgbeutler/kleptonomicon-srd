 The [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet/04 Status Box\|Status Box]] on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] shows how close you are to death.

![P1 StatusBox.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/P1%20StatusBox.png)

The incoming damage that you face can be reduced if it matches the restrictions of one of your [[#Defenses]] at the top of the [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet/04 Status Box\|Status Box]]. Your [[#Defenses]] are often only usable if the incoming damage is of a certain [[#Damage Types|Damage Type]].

Conversely, your [[#Weaknesses]] can also be triggered by certain [[#Damage Types]], but will bring about adverse side effects, like gaining [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]] or taking extra damage. Not all characters will have [[#Weaknesses]]. You will likely only gain one if you take on a stronger [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Trait Ability\|Trait Ability]], like some monstrous features.

At the bottom of the [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet/04 Status Box\|Status Box]] is a set of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Point Bank\|Point Banks]]. This is where you will track your [[#Recoveries]], [[#Dodges]], [[#Shield]], [[#Health]], and [[#Vitality]], along with other unique points that you may gain as a part of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Constitution\|SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Constitution]].

Your [[#Shield]] can help provide a temporary buffer of hit-points. Your [[#Health]] is used as your main tally from which damage will be subtracted. When your [[#Health]] has been depleted, you then must rely on your [[#Vitality]] that represents the the final threads that separate you from... death.

[[#Dodges]] give you a limited number of chances to avoid damage per [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]]. [[#Recoveries]] can be used to restore [[#Health]] and [[#Vitality]] in moments of downtime.

Note that the end of each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]], you will be able to reset your [[#Recoveries]], [[#Shield]], [[#Health]], and [[#Vitality]] along with resetting your other points needed by your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], which can be tracked in the [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet/04 Status Box\|Status Box]].

## Defenses
Before damage is applied to your [[#Shield]], [[#Health]], or [[#Vitality]] and before you gain any stacks of a new [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]], your [[#Defenses]] will first be applied. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Defense\|Defense]] can be applied if its listed [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Damage Type]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]] type matches and if all other listed requirements have been met.

There are three types of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Defense\|Defenses]]: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Immunity\|Immunities]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Resistance\|Resistances]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Weakness\|Weaknesses]].
###### Resistances
A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Resistance\|Resistance]] lets you half (rounding down) the incoming [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage\|Damage]] of the matching [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Damage Type]] or, in the case of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]], lets you half (rounding down) the number of stacks that you gain of that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]].

By default, everyone starts with the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Take Cover\|Take Cover]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Resistance\|Resistance]]:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




[Defense:: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Resistance\|Resistance]]]
[Trigger:: All [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid Damage]] if you have at least 1/2 cover or are [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]]]

:LiSparkle-solid:



</div></div>


So, to use your [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Take Cover\|Take Cover]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Resistance\|Resistance]], the incoming damage must have the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Major Damage Type]] of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid Damage]] and you must have at least half cover or the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] status.

All [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Resistance\|Resistances]] are optional and some will list a small downside to using it. For example, you may only be able to half the incoming damage if you gain a stack of a certain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]].
###### Immunities
An [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Immunity\|Immunity]] lets you avoid *all* incoming [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage\|Damage]] of the matching [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Damage Type]] or avoid all stacks of the matching [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]].

Just like with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Resistance\|Resistances]], certain conditions may need to be met or certain downsides may need to be taken on before you can use the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Immunity\|Immunity]].
###### Weaknesses
Unlike with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Resistance\|Resistances]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Weakness\|Weaknesses]] are always applied if the listed [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Damage Type]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]], and/or other conditions are met. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Weakness\|Weakness]] that matches always doubles the amount of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage\|Damage]] or the number of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stacks]] of a matching [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Damage Type]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Condition]], respectively.

A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Weakness\|Weakness]] may also have other effects, like causing a creature to catch fire and start dealing additional [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Fire Damage]] with each attack.

### Dodge Points
Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Dodge Point\|Dodge Points]] determine how many uses you have left of the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Dodge\|Dodge Ability]]. You can regain your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Dodge Point\|Dodge Point]] by using the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Rest\|Rest Ability]].

### Shield
Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]] represents an added level of protection or a boost of temporary health.

Any incoming damage (that remains *after* applying your [[#Defenses]]) is first subtracted from your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]] points. If your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]] reaches 0, it will then immediately flow over into your [[#Health]] or [[#Vitality]]. Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]] cannot go below 0 and no explicit maximum.

When you (or someone else) uses an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that refreshes your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]], you should set your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]] equal to the new value, unless your current number of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]] points is higher. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Shield\|Shield]] points are *never* added to preexisting points.

## Health
Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]] is your largest tally of points from which damage will be subtracted. Your total amount of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]] is usually 10, but may be altered by your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Constitution\|Constitution]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perks]] you gain throughout the game (for better or for worse.)

When your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]] reaches 0, any remaining damage is immediately discarded. While your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]] is at 0, you are considered #unstable. While #unstable, new damage will be applied to your [[#Vitality]], as described in the section on [[#Vitality]]. When healed back to non-zero health, you are no longer #unstable.

## Vitality
While your [[#Health]] is at 0, you are considered #unstable and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]] becomes the only thing that separates you from #death. Any new damage you take that is greater than 0 (after applying #Defenses) will result in losing one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]]. If ever the amount of damage is greater than 10, you will also lose extra vitality equal the damage amount divided by 10 (rounded down.)

If ever you reach 0 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]], you die, unless the damage was specified to be #non-lethal, in which case you will fall [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Unconscious\|Unconscious]].

Player characters generally start at 4 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]], though some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Constitution\|Constitutions]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perks]] may alter that value (for better or for worse.) Many non-player characters may also have more or less [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]]. You may also choose to deal #non-lethal to a non-player character to knock them [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Unconscious\|Unconscious]] at 0 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]]. (Though, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may have you roll a #Specialist [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] to ensure that you didn't kill them on accident.)

## Recoveries
When you are running low on [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]], you may need to take a moment to recover and tend to your wounds. Below is a look at the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Rest\|Rest]] ability from the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities\|Basic Ability List]] appendix, which will be one of your go-to ways to restore [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]]:

<!-- TODO: could have players be downed while they still have Recovery. Treat recovery as the vitality of death saves mode..?-->

</div></div>


If you ever run out of #recoveries, you may need to use your #General_Wealth to look for a [[SRD/Appendix/Items/General Items/First Aid Kit\|First Aid Kit]]. First aid kits grant you an additional #Recovery and may even let you use it immediately (depending on the quality of the first aid kit.)
