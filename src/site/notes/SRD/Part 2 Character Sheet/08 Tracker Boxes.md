The first two boxes on **Page 3** of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] contain everything you will need to build and improve your character as you play.

At the top-right of the page you will find a small box to track your [[#Experience]] points. Below that will be a place to track your character's [[#Level Tracker]] and [[#Archetype Trackers]]. Each of the four #trackers also comes with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perks]] that you can choose from as you [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level Up]].

At the center-top of the page, you will find the [[#Lineage]] box, which will help you in narrowing down what [[#Trait Features]] may fit best for your character. Below that box, you will find a place to note your [[#Constitution]] and [[#Class]] along with a place to log which [[#Trait Features]] and [[#Class Features]] you chose to take.

## Experience

For each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Experience Point\|Experience Point]] you gain, you will mark one bubble on the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Experience Point\|Experience]] track found on Page 3 of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]].

![P3 ExperienceTracker.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/P3%20ExperienceTracker.png)

Once the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Experience Point\|Experience]] track has been filled by gaining 20 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Experience Point\|Experience Points]], you can [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level Up]]. When you [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level Up]], reset your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Experience Point\|Experience]] to 0, add one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] to your [[#Level Tracker]], and add one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] to one of your [[#Archetype Trackers]].

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will usually reward [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Experience Point\|Experience Points]] at key points in the story and two points at the end of each successful [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/04 Phases of Play\|Encounter]] that you are involved in. Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may also grant [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Experience Point\|Experience]] for completing hidden, [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Secondary Objective\|Secondary Objectives]].

The most common [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Secondary Objective\|Secondary Objectives]] involve staying engaged with the story by:
* Learning important information from your discussions with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]].
* Uncovering new, hidden details about the current story.
* Finding or interacting with important objects.
* Achieving goals in an optional, more difficult way.

## Level Tracker
The **Level Tracker** is where you will track your overall character [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]], along with the number of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Social Ability\|Social]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class Ability\|Class]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Trait Ability\|Trait]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] that you can gain and have already gained.

![P3 LevelTracker.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/P3%20LevelTracker.png)

#### Level
Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] generally starts at 1 and cannot exceed 15, though your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may begin your character at a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] higher than 1.

At [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] 1, you get a starting number of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] that you can pick up (2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Social Ability\|Social Abilities]], 5 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Trait Ability\|Trait Abilities]], and 3 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class Ability\|Class Abilities]]) for creating your character. These can be found in the first column of the [[#Level Tracker]].

Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] may limit what [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] you can gain. Many [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] will list a certain minimum [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] as one of their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Requirement\|Requirements]]. If you cannot meet that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Requirement\|Requirement]], then the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] cannot be taken (as it would always [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Fail]].)

Whenever you gain a [[#Level]], you will also be able to learn new [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] of each type found in the current [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level's]] column of the [[#Level Tracker]]. You should wait to choose any new [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] until the end of the current [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]], unless your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] says otherwise. All available [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] can be found in the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities\|Ability List]] [[SRD/Appendix\|Appendix]] .

At certain [[#Level|Levels]], as shown on the tracker, you will also be able to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Upgrade\|Upgrade]] certain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]]. For example, at [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] 3 you gain your choice of a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class Ability\|Class]] or a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Trait Ability\|Trait Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Upgrade\|Upgrade]]. In order to take an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Upgrade\|Upgrade]], you must first know the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. All [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Upgrade\|Upgrades]] for an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] can be found listed at the bottom of that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. Much like [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] themselves, you may need to reach certain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Levels]] before you can take on those [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Upgrade\|Upgrades]].

Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Upgrade\|Upgrades]] will be named the same, suffixed by a number (as in **Powerful(1)** and **Powerful(2)**.) These [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Upgrade\|Upgrades]] are a series. A series has an implicit requirement that you take each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Upgrade\|Upgrade]] in order, with the latest one superseding the details of the previous one for a stronger effect.

[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Prestige Upgrade\|Prestige Upgrades]] allow you to take on new, powerful abilities that help shape and define your character in more pronounced ways. If you cannot find a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Prestige Upgrade\|Prestige Upgrade]] that you want to take, it can also be used to gain any other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Upgrade\|Upgrade]] on any other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].

> [!eg]- Example: #Alice gains a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]], bringing her to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] 2.
> * #Alice fills in the `2` on the top row of her [[#Level_Tracker]].
> * Checking the '2' column of the [[#Level_Tracker]], #Alice finds that she can gain one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class Ability\|Class Ability]].
> * #Alice waits until the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]] has come to a close.
> * #Alice selects a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class Ability\|Class Ability]] (that is available to a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] 2 character) then fills in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class Ability\|Class Ability]] bubble on the [[#Level Tracker]] to indicate that she has made her choice.

#### Level Perks
At each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]], you can also choose one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perk]] from the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perk]] list at the bottom of the [[#Level Tracker]]. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perk]] list is divided into two columns. The left column are [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Basic Perks]]. After choosing your fifth [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Basic Perk]] (usually at level 5), you unlock the ability to start choosing [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Advanced Perks]] from the right column.

All [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perks]] can be chosen immediately upon [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Leveling Up]] and their benefits can be used in the current [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]].

> [!eg]- Example: #Alice gains a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]], bringing her to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] 2. (Continued.)
> * After #Alice levels up to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] 2, #Alice can immediately choose a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Level Perk]].
> * #Alice has only one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Basic Perk]], so she cannot yet choose an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Advanced Perk]]. #Alice chooses the perk that lets her gain one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Social Ability\|Social Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Upgrade\|Upgrade]].

If you need a more detailed description of what each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Level Perk]] does, see the [[SRD/Appendix/Perk List\|Perk List]].

## Archetype Trackers

There are three **Archetype Trackers** that grant [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetype]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perks]] unique to each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetype]]. The three [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetypes]] are: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Fighter]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Rogue]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Mage]].

You will need to decide which [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetypes]] will best represent your character and then prioritize that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetype]] when choosing where to assign your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Archetype Levels]]. Generally speaking, you will probably want to choose the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetype]] that matches your highest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Stat\|Exploration Stat]], as each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] you gain will generally have higher rates of success if you do.

#### Archetype Level
Whenever your character gains a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]], you will also gain one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Archetype Level]], to be put into one of the three [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetypes]]' [[#Archetype Trackers|Trackers]].

When you start the game, you will start by choosing a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Primary Archetype\|Primary Archetype]] and a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Secondary Archetype\|Secondary Archetype]]. Once chose, you will be able to immediately place 4 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Levels]] into your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Primary Archetype\|Primary Archetype]], gaining all benefits of those levels. You will also be able to place 2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Levels]] into your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Secondary Archetype\|Secondary Archetype]], again gaining the benefits of those levels.

Each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetype]] has a maximum [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] of 15. Since your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Primary Archetype\|Primary Archetype]] starts at [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level]] 4, that means you will end up with at least 4 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Levels]] that you will have to spend in an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetype]] other than your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Primary Archetype\|Primary Archetype]]. Most of the time you will want to spend those points on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Secondary Archetype\|Secondary Archetype]], so you can benefit from its [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Advanced Perks]], but you are not required to do so.

#### Archetype Perks
Just like on the [[#Level Tracker]], the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perks]] are divided into [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Basic Perks]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Advanced Perks]]. Before you can choose the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Advanced Perks]] of an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetype]], you must first chose 5 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Basic Perks]] of that [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetype]].
### Fighter Tracker
![P3 FighterTracker.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/P3%20FighterTracker.png)
Every 3 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Fighter]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Levels]] you will gain an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] from the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Archetype Abilities/Fighter Abilities\|Fighter Ability List]].

For a detailed description of what each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Fighter Perk]] does, see the [[SRD/Appendix/Perk List\|Perk List]].

### Rogue Tracker
![P3 RogueTracker.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/P3%20RogueTracker.png)
Every 2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Rogue]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Levels]], you will gain an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] from the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Archetype Abilities/Rogue Abilities\|Rogue Ability List]].

For a detailed description of what each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Rogue Perk]] does, see the [[SRD/Appendix/Perk List\|Perk List]].

### Mage Tracker
![P3 MageTracker.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/P3%20MageTracker.png)
Every three [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Mage]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Levels]] you will gain a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] from the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Archetype Abilities/Mage Abilities\|Mage Ability List]]. At all other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Mage]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Levels]] you will instead gain a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Spell Ability\|Spell Ability]] from the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Spell Abilities\|Spell Ability List]].

For a detailed description of what each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Mage Perk]] does, see the [[SRD/Appendix/Perk List\|Perk List]].
