A name can be a powerful thing. Before your character can be complete, you will need to think of a name. If you want to go by a more mysterious name, you will still need to also come up with your character's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ceremonial Name\|Ceremonial Name]].

## Ceremonial Name
A few rare [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Spell Ability\|Spell Abilities]] require that the caster know the target's true [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ceremonial Name\|Ceremonial Name]] before that creature can be targeted. Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ceremonial Name\|Ceremonial Name]] is the first name given to you after you were born. It can easily be changed for free by a cleric or a state officiant using the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Spell Abilities/Bless\|Bless Spell Ability]].

> [!eg] Example: Using a Ceremonial Name
> #Alice wishes to contact her teammate, #Bob, using the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Spell Abilities/Sending\|Sending]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Spell Ability\|Spell Ability]]. #Alice knows that #Bob's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ceremonial Name\|Ceremonial Name]] is "Bob Smaggar" and is able to target home with ease.
> 
> Later, the team learns that the main baddie goes by "Aladorax" and #Alice attempts to use [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Spell Abilities/Sending\|Sending]] to contact him. The spell ends up failing, as "Aladorax" is not the baddie's full or true [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ceremonial Name\|Ceremonial Name]].
