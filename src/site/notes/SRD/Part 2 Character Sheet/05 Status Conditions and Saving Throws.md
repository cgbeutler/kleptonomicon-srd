Many **Spells**, **Traps**, and **Abilities** can inflict **Status Conditions**. When you are hit by something that says it "Inflicts" something, you will need to succeed on rolling a [[#Saves|Save]] or become afflicted by the [[#Status Condition]] listed. [[#Saves|Saves]] also help you avoid damage from some sources, like traps and spells. Occasionally, you will use a [[#Saves|Save]] for other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]], like determining turn order in combat or your level of focus on an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].

Your [[#Saves]] and [[#Status Conditions]] can be found on the left side of the **Status** box on your **Character Sheet**.

![P1 ConditionsBox.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/P1%20ConditionsBox.png)
## Saves
Your saves **Saves** help you avoid [[#Status Conditions]] and some damage.

The **Saves** and their use cases are as follows:
###### Grit
* Use your fortitude and determination to save yourself from poison, exhaustion, cold, blunt trauma, grapples, getting knocked back, getting knocked down, being swept downstream, etc.
###### Edge
* Use your foresight and cunning to save yourself from projectiles, traps, attacks targeting weak-points, sudden environmental dangers, tricky illusions, etc.
* Also used to determine turn order at the start of an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]].
###### Focus
* Use your mental fortitude and tuning to save yourself from psychic attacks, magical charms, magical fears, possession and more.
* Also used to maintain spells that require [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Concentration\|Concentration]].

Each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]] is based on a different [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Stat\|Exploration Stat]] and can be [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Improvement\|Improved]] through various [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perks]] (which will be discussed in [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet/08 Tracker Boxes\|08 Tracker Boxes]].) You may also be granted bonuses to these [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Saves]] through other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Items]].

When rolling one of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Saves]], you will perform the usual `d10` [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. If an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] is what triggered the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]], you can roll with an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] if your opponent's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] was a \[..6] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Low Score]]. Conversely, you will need to roll with a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] if your opponent's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] was a \[10..] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|High Score]]. If your opponent got a \[7..9] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]], you make the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Save]] as normal.

## Status Conditions

Learning to use [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]] can help you overcome your enemies, but your enemies can also use them to weaken and overpower you. Most [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]] have two levels represented by "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stacks]]". For each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stack]] of a condition, the condition's effect can becomes stronger or last longer.

There are two main types of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]]:
* [[#Fleeting Conditions]] : Conditions that lose one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stack]] (or level) at the end of your turn.
* [[#Persistent Conditions]] : Conditions that retain their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stacks]] until certain ending conditions are met.

Note that the above is true for [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] as well.

Each of the main [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]] is listed below. A shortened description of each is also provided on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]].

Other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]] exist which are more rare. These rare conditions can be found in the [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions\|Conditions List]] appendix or on the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Item\|Item]], or #creature that inflicts said [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Condition]].

### Fleeting Conditions
[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fleeting Condition\|Fleeting Conditions]] lose one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stack]] at the end of your turn. A complete list can be found in the [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions\|Conditions List]] appendix.

One of the more important [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fleeting Condition\|Fleeting Conditions]] to understand is the [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Strained\|Strained]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fleeting Condition\|Fleeting Condition]]:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




[Type:: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fleeting Condition\|Fleeting]]]

[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] with the "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Straining\|Straining]]" [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Penalty\|Penalty]] (or "[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Straining\|Straining]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]]") impose one stack of **Strained** if you [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Pass]] their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]].

All [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Straining\|Straining]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] have one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] for each stack of **Strained** that you have.


</div></div>


This [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Condition]] imposes limits on your stronger [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] by making it difficult to use them back-to-back. Be aware of which [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Straining\|Straining]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] and be sure to give yourself enough time for your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stacks]] of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Strained\|Strained]] to wear off before using another [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Straining\|Straining]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]].

###### Core Fleeting Conditions
Of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fleeting Condition\|Fleeting Conditions]], there are ten [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Core Fleeting Condition\|Core Fleeting Conditions]]. A summary of each can be found on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]].

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Core Fleeting Condition\|Core Fleeting Conditions]] in more detail are:

**2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stacks]]:** You are fully frightened. In addition to the base effect, while the source of this condition is visible, you cannot willingly move closer to it.


</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">

**2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stacks]]:** Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] is 0. You cannot move or stand up.

This condition does not itself interrupt any [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]].


</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




**1 or 2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stack]]:** You have a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on all [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Saves]].

</div></div>


###### Wounds
Whenever you take [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage\|Damage]] directly to your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]], you will gain a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wound\|Wound]]. To gain a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wound\|Wound]], you will have to make a special [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wound\|Wound]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] that will randomly giving you a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Core Fleeting Condition\|Core Fleeting Condition]] as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Persistent Condition\|Persistent Condition]] that lasts until you heal a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]] (Only one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stack]] of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wound\|Wounds]] is removed per [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Vitality\|Vitality]] healed. Your healer chooses which [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stack]] is removed.)

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wound\|Wound]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] is also used by a few [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] that can randomly inflict or alter your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]], though those [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] will usually only inflict the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Conditions]] as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fleeting Condition\|Fleeting Condition]] instead of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Persistent Condition\|Persistent Conditions]] like a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wound\|Wound]] does.

> [!note] Use your Character Sheet!
> The list below is in the same order on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]]. The exact order does not matter so long as [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Bloodied\|Bloodied]] is the result of getting a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Failure]] and 'No Effect' is the result of getting a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Success]].

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Wound\|Wound]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] is made with no [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]]:
* \[0!] Gain a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Bloodied\|Bloodied]].
* \[1] Gain a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Blunted\|Blunted]].
* \[2] Gain a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Charmed\|Charmed]].
* \[3] Gain a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Dazed\|Dazed]].
* \[4] Gain a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Frightened\|Frightened]].
* \[5] Gain a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Restrained\|Restrained]].
* \[6] Gain a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Silenced\|Silenced]].
* \[7] Gain a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]].
* \[8] Gain a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Susceptible\|Susceptible]].
* \[9] Gain a stack of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Vulnerable\|Vulnerable]].
* \[10!] No Effect.

###### Supplemental Fleeting Conditions
There are many other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fleeting Condition\|Fleeting Conditions]]. Some of the supplemental [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fleeting Condition\|Fleeting Conditions]] will simply be defined as a combination of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Core Fleeting Condition\|Core Fleeting Conditions]]. In these cases, you will simply mark each listed [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Core Fleeting Condition\|Core Fleeting Condition]] with the number of stacks described. The stacks of each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Core Fleeting Condition\|Core Fleeting Condition]] are not strictly tied together and your various [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] may alleviate or prevent those [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Status Conditions]] individually.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




[[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Blunted\|Blunted]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Vulnerable\|Vulnerable]].

**1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stack]]:** You can only partially see.
**2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stacks]]:** you cannot see.


</div></div>


### Persistent Conditions
[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Persistent Condition\|Persistent Conditions]] stay in effect until a given condition is met. The ending condition could be things like waiting a certain amount of time, applying a certain item, successfully performing a certain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] on your turn, etc.

Occasionally you will see a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fleeting Condition\|Fleeting Condition]] that gets inflicted as a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Persistent Condition\|Persistent Condition]]. In those cases, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Status Condition\|Condition]] has the same effect, but its [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stacks]] will not go away at the end of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] and must instead be alleviated according to the rules described by the source of the condition.

Several of the core [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Persistent Condition\|Persistent Conditions]] are centered around the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Grapple\|Grapple]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]]. Any character can attempt to [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Grapple\|Grapple]] another creature.

The core [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Persistent Condition\|Persistent Conditions]] are as follows:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] that target anything other than yourself or the target of your grapple have a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]].

This condition ends if:
* You use a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Action\|Free Action]] or a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]] to end the grapple.
* You and the target of your grapple are no longer in [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] of one another.
* You fall [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Unconscious\|Unconscious]].
* The target of the grapple succeeds a saving throw against this grapple.


</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




> You have been grabbed or picked up by another creature.

**1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stack]]:** You are immobile. Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] is 0.
**2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stacks]]:** You are [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Blunted\|Blunted]]. The source of this condition can carry you by spending double [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]].

You may retry the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Grit Save]] against the source's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fighter Stat\|Fighter Stat]] as:
* An [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Action\|Action]] on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]].
* A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]] when the source of this condition takes damage.


</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




> A creature has jumped on your back, got you in a chokehold, or has hitched a ride on you in some way.

**1 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stack]]:** The source of this condition is attached you to you and shares a square with you. When you take [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] on your turn, the source can use a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]] to move with you.
2 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stacks]]: You are [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Blunted\|Blunted]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed]](2) and can be [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Choked\|Choked]].

You may retry the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Save\|Edge Save]] against the source's [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fighter Stat\|Fighter Stat]] as:
* An [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Action\|Action]] on your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]].
* A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]] when the source of this condition takes damage.

</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




When someone **Mounts** and then successfully **Chokes** you, you will gain one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stack]] of this condition. This increases by one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stack\|Stack]] if you are successfully **Choked** again. If you are successfully **Choked** a third time, you fall [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Unconscious\|Unconscious]]. When you break free from the source of the **Choking** condition (be that breaking free from being **Mounted**, underwater, or trapped in a cloud of toxic gas), you can recover 1 stack of **Choked** immediately and another at the end of your next turn. (If you have already fallen [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Unconscious\|Unconscious]], that condition will need to be removed separately.)
* **Choked(1)**
  * You cannot speak or make any other vocal noise.
  * You cannot cast any [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] that requires a verbal component.
* **Choked(2)**
  * You are **Vulnerable** for the duration (meaning you can only use your **Base Defense** to mitigate incoming damage.)
