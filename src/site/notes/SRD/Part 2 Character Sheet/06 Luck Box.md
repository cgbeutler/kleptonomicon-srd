You cannot always depend on you skills to save you. Some things require good, old-fashioned luck. For all things **Luck** you will turn to the #Luck_Box.

![P1 LuckBox.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/P1%20LuckBox.png)

The #Luck_Box contains your current number of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Favor\|Favors]] and your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Luck Stat\|Luck Stat]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]].

## Luck Stat
Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Luck Stat\|Luck Stat]] is used to when performing a luck-based [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. Everyone starts with the same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] of `+1`.

There are very few ways to increase your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Luck Stat\|Luck Stat]]. One of those ways is to choose the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Level Up]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perk]] that increases your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Luck Stat\|Luck Stat]].

## Favors
You can spend [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Favor\|Favors]] to reroll one die during a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]]. When you do so, you must take the new result. You must announce that you are using your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Favor\|Favor]] before the effects of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] become active.

At the start of each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]] you gain a number of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Favor\|Favors]] equal to your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Luck Stat\|Luck Stat]]. You cannot have more than 4 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Favor\|Favors]] banked at any one time, so be sure to use them, or new ones could be lost! The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may also grant you [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Favor\|Favors]] as a reward for good roleplaying and for embracing a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Low Score]] by roleplaying character growth.
