At the top of **Page 2** of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]], you will find a reference to your [[#Default Damage]] values: your [[#Melee Damage]] and your [[#Ranged Damage]].

Below that, you will find several boxed used for [[#Organizing Abilities]] that you gain throughout the game. Each box is labeled with the category of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] that should go within that box: #Primary [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], #Secondary [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], and #Tertiary [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]].

It is recommended that you learn use the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] shorthand discussed in [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/05 Abilities\|05 Abilities]]. Doing so will help save space and help you find things faster while playing.

## Weapon Damage Boxes
Your [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Melee Attack\|Melee Attack]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Ranged Attack\|Ranged Attack]] can have their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage\|Damage]] modified by what [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perks]] you choose and what weapons you use. These changes to the total amount of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage\|Damage]] that you will deal can be noted in the **Weapon Damage Boxes**.
###### Melee Damage Box
Place the total amount of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage\|Damage]] you will deal with your [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Melee Attack\|Melee Attack]] here. If you do not have a [[SRD/Appendix/Items/General Items/Melee Weapon\|Melee Weapon]] or any [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Perks]], you should note the default of `1` [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid/Blunt Damage]] here.

If every you find yourself without a melee weapon, you will be considered #unarmed. While unarmed, you will have to roll with a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] and you will deal [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid/Blunt Damage]], unless you have natural weapons, like claws or horns. Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], like those gained by the #Class/Brawler class, may grant an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] while #unarmed, effectively removing the default #unarmed [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]].
###### Ranged Damage
This is the amount of damage dealt by your primary ranged weapon. The *specific* weapon that you wield is, again, considered flavor. The amount of damage you deal will be the same if you choose a crossbow or throwing hammers. That said, you will need to choose which damage type best fits the weapon flavor you chose. Usually, that damage type is [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid/Blunt Damage]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid/Sharp Damage]], as noted at the bottom of the #ranged_damage box. Your #ranged_damage amount always starts at 1. This value can be raised as you gain [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Levels]] and take on [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perk\|Level Perks]].

<!--TODO-->
If every you find yourself without a ranged weapon, you will be considered #unarmed. While unarmed, you can still make #improvised #ranged attacks by throwing objects you find nearby. When making an #improvised #ranged attack, you will have to roll with a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] and you will deal [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Damage Type\|Solid/Blunt Damage]], unless you were able to find an object to throw that would deal some other type of damage. Some [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], like those gained by the #Class/Brawler class, may grant an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Advantage\|Advantage]] to #ranged attacks while #unarmed, effectively removing the default #unarmed [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]].


## Organizing Abilities
You have three [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype Stat\|Archetype Stats]] which are used when performing your various [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] (see [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/05 Abilities\|05 Abilities]] and the upcoming chapter on [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet/08 Tracker Boxes\|08 Tracker Boxes]], for more.) To help keep things clean, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] page of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] contains three boxes, one for each of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype Stat\|Archetype Stats]].

![P2 PrimaryBox.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/P2%20PrimaryBox.png)
![P2 SecondaryBox.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/P2%20SecondaryBox.png)
![P2 TertiaryBox.png](/img/user/_img/char_sheet/P2%20TertiaryBox.png)

After setting up a new character, you will generally take your highest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype Stat\|Archetype Stat]] and write it in the #Primary_Box. Your second-highest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype Stat\|Archetype Stat]] will then be copied to the #Secondary_Box. Lastly, your lowest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype Stat\|Archetype Stat]] will be copied into the #Tertiary_Box.

Once each box has been labeled, you can then copy all your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] into the box that corresponds with the ability needed for that skill.

> [!eg] Example: #Bob's Abilities
> #Bob has just finished filling out page 3 of his [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]], the character builder page. He is now filling out page 2, the abilities page.
> * #Bob has more [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Levels]] in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Fighter Archetype]] than any other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetype]].
>   #Bob writes 'Fighter' on the blank line inside the #Primary_Box.
> * #Bob writes his [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fighter Stat\|Fighter Stat]] of `3` in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] box next to the word 'Primary' in the #Primary_Box.
> * #Bob notes that his next highest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Level\|Archetype Level]] is the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Rogue Archetype]].
>   #Bob writes 'Rogue' on the blank line inside the #Secondary_Box.
> * #Bob writes his [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Rogue Stat\|Rogue Stat]] of `1` in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] box next to the word 'Secondary' in the #Secondary_Box.
> * #Bob's only remaining [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Archetype]] is the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype\|Mage Archetype]].
>   #Bob writes 'Mage' on the blank line inside the #Tertiary_Box.
> * #Bob writes his [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Mage Stat\|Mage Stat]] of `0` in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] box next to the word 'Tertiary' in the #Tertiary_Box.
> * Now that all boxes are labeled, #Bob copies down all of his [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]], placing each in it's appropriate box.

### Ability Time Shorthand
When copying an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] to your character sheet, you will generally organize each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] into the section of the relevant [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Skill\|Skill]] and note the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]] next to it: "A" for [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Action\|Action]], "FA" for [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Action\|Free Action]], "SA" for [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Slow Action\|Slow Action]], "R" for [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]], "FR" for [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Free Reaction\|Free Reaction]], or "P" for [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Passive\|Passive]].

If an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] has any special notes about its [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]], like if there are conditions associated with that time, then you should mark your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability Time\|Ability Time]] with an asterisk.
