## Exploration Stats

Each character has a different balance of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Stat\|Exploration Stats]] that help you navigate the world and interact with it.

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Stat\|Exploration Stats]] are:
###### Might
The front-line force of the group. Favored stat of skilled strikers, bulky athletes, and seasoned warriors.
###### Artifice
The back-line specialist of the group. Favored stat of dexterous fighters, skillful snipers, and nimble-handed craftsmen.
###### Tuning
The magical conduit of the group. Favored stat of Dark mages and enlightened sages.

#### Starting Exploration Stats
Ask your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] how they want to generate stats.  There are two primary methods:

<!--TODO: Are these still accurate for exploration and social?-->
> [!note]- Stat Gen Method: Point-Roll
> 
> Start with each stat equal to `-1`. Perform a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] with a `+0` [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Modifier\|Modifier]] four times. Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]] determines which [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Stat\|Exploration Stat]] you gain:
> 
> [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]]:
> * \[0!\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Failure]]. No [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Stat\|Stat]] increase.
> * \[1..3\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Stat\|Might]] +1.
> * \[4..6\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Stat\|Artifice]] +1.
> * \[7..9\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Stat\|Tuning]] +1.
> * \[10!\] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Critical Roll\|Critical Success]]. Your lowest [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Stat\|Exploration Stat]] gets +1. (Choose in the case of a tie.)
> 
> > Example:
> > * #Bob rolls `4d10` and gets `1, 3, 4, 9`.
> > * Using the chart above, #Bob determines his stats are Might `1`, Artifice of `0`, and Tuning `0`.

> [!note]- Stat Gen Method: Point-Buy
> 
> Start with each stat equal to `-1`. Assign 4 points to any stat you choose.
> 
> > Example:
> > * #Alice assigns 0 points to Might, 1 point to Artifice, and 3 points to Tuning.
> > * #Alice's stats are Might `-1`, Artifice `0`, and Tuning `2`.

### Exploration Skills

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Skill\|Exploration Skills]] are divided up on the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] into a grid. In each column, you can see how the [[#Exploration Stats]] relate to each of the 4 [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Stat\|Exploration Stats]]. The first row of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Skill\|Exploration Skills]] are the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Perception Skills]]. The next row contains the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skills]], and the final two rows contain the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Knowledge Skill\|Knowledge Skills]]. (You do not need to memorize these categories, they are mainly there to help you find the skills more quickly.)

### Perception Skills
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Perception Skills]] help you learn more about new locations you explore and can help you detect and avoid danger before it happens.

The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Perception Skills]] are most often used with the the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Investigate\|Investigate]] ability:
(This ability can also be found on the [[Player Cheat Sheet\|Player Cheat Sheet]].)

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




[Time:: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Reaction\|Reaction]]] [Target:: Current Location]
[Trigger:: After you enter a new room or area and hear the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] description of general features of that room]
[Test:: Choose [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Security]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Analysis]], or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Sensing]]]
[Effect:: Knowledge]

Each room or area can only be the target of this [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Ability]] once perÂ [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Episode\|Episode]].

Your chosen [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Perception Skill's]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score\|Score]]:
* \[..6] You don't get to ask any questions.
* \[7..9] You can ask 1 question below.
* \[10..] You can ask 2 question below.
* \[10!] One of your questions can be any question, provided the answer could be gleaned by one of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Perception Skills]].

You can ask your questions immediately or wait, taking actions and playing as normal between each question asked. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] will respond with basic, but accurate information. (Further info can be gained by roleplaying investigation in more specific ways. Those further investigations often won't require a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Perception Skill]], but may require [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Knowledge Skill\|Knowledge Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]].)

The questions you may ask depend on what [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Perception Skill]] you chose:
* [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Security]]
  * What is the best way in or out?
  * What sorts of creatures are here or nearby?
  * What's one feature that holds a hidden danger?
  * What seen threat is the biggest threat (to me or someone else)?
  * Is there a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/General Good\|General Good]] nearby? If so, where is it?
* [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Analysis]]
  * How does this mechanism or setup work?
  * Is a given wall an internal, external, or boundary wall?
  * What wear patterns do I see and which worn paths are most/least used?
  * Is a given item likely to be here? If so, approximately where is it?
  * Is there a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/General Good\|General]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Grey Good\|Grey]], or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Obscure Good\|Obscure Good]] (choose one) nearby? If so, where is it?
* [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Sensing]]
  * Has magic been cast here within the last hour? If so, where are the afterimages?
  * Is there an invisible thing in this area?
  * Is there an active magical effect or aura in this area?
  * Is that item or feature magical?
  * Is there an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Obscure Good\|Obscure Good]] nearby? If so, where is it?


</div></div>


Note that each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Skill\|Skill]] has a different set of questions that can be asked. In this way, each character's own perceptions may reveal different information about the current location.

Aside from the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Investigate\|Investigate]] ability, the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may have you make [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] using the various [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Perception Skills]] while you are diving deeper into what you have found in the world.

Below are the three core [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Perception Skills]] and examples of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may call for:
###### Recon
- Secure a campsite.
- Determine the weak and strong points of security. Predict security features, protocols, spells, etc.
- Keep watch or scout ahead to detect sights and sounds of nearby living things that may be using [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Stealth]].
- Identify leadership and hierarchies. Identify lower members of a group that may be more susceptible to attacks, be that physical or rhetorical.
- Gather details that may help determine a character's rank or threat level (though a creature's magical or unseen capabilities may require a [[#^Discord]] or [[#^Harmony]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]].)
###### Analysis
- Track an enemy. While in an encounter against a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Stealthy]] enemy, determine the route that an enemy traveled.
- Look over specific objects or phenomena to quickly and _safely_ gather clues. Determine how a non-magical mechanism or trap works.
- Search for info or a specific item quickly or while under pressure.
- Generally, this skill will not involve altering the subject in any way. For alterations, dissection, or dismantling, use [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Sleight Skill]] instead.
###### Sensing
- Sense the presence of [[SRD/Appendix/Conditions/Invisible\|Invisible]] beings, magical auras, or magical effects in the area (though you will not learn their exact location.)
- With a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|High Score]] you may be able to see auras. You may also be able to see the afterimage of magic cast within the last hour and gain clues as to what spell was cast (Though further rolls of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Conjuring Skill\|Conjuring Skill]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Enchanting Skill\|Enchanting Skill]] may be needed for full identification.) It is also worth noting that some magic can be altered or hidden from your senses through abilities like [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Class Abilities/_TODO_/Wizard/Cryptoarcanology\|Cryptoarcanology]].
- With a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Mixed Score]] you may only feel a general presence with no clear location or direction. You may also miss dormant magic items or dormant magical effects.
- On a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Score Range\|Low Score]] you may miss magic that is there or get incorrect information about the magic in the area, though the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] could also tell you the truth. Be careful, as this could lead you into a magical trap!

While the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Perception Skill\|Perception Skills]] can be used for the usual [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Skill\|Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may implore, they are most often used by players performing the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Investigate\|Investigate Ability]] upon entering a new area or room.

### Covert Skills
Below are the three core [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skills]] that help you avoid detection. The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] may occasionally use these [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Skill\|Skills]] in other ways, but you will generally only roll them during [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/06 Covert Operations\|06 Covert Operations]]. (See that chapter for a more complete guide on the stealth system.)
###### [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Stealth]]
- Walk through the world without being heard or seen.
- [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] when you are [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] and walk into the #perception_range of anyone looking vaguely in your direction.
- [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] when you are [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] and walk into the #half_perception_range of someone.
###### [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Sleight]]
- Act with care and grace to reduce noise and flashiness.
- [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] when you are [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] and performing a #noisy action while in  #half_perception_range of someone.
- [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] when you are [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] and performing a #loud action while in  #perception_range of someone.
###### [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Hiding]]
- Hide or camouflage yourself or other people or objects.
- [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Covert Skill\|Covert Skill]] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] when you are [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Sneaky\|Sneaky]] and a creature walks within  #perception_range of you and can at least partially see you.

### Knowledge Skills
[[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Knowledge Skill\|Knowledge Skills]] are representative of what a character knows. Often, these skills will determine how much you "recall" about a given subject or topic. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Knowledge Skill\|Knowledge Skills]] are used a bit less often than other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Skill\|Skills]], but you are required to put at least half of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Improvement\|Skill Improvements]] into your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Knowledge Skill\|Knowledge Skills]].

Below are the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Knowledge Skill\|Knowledge Skills]] and example use cases for each:
###### [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Athletics Skill\|Athletics Skill]] (Might)
*Raw might can only get you so far, you also need athletic knowledge.*
* Perform more demanding or hazardous feat of sport, like acrobatics, climbing, swimming, wrestling, etc.
* Climb or hold on to a slippery, unstable, or hazardous surface while something is trying to knock you off.
* Say afloat in difficult waters or while something is trying to interfere with your swimming.
* Lift or carry heavy objects. You can freely lift and carry objects that are your same size and weight or less. If the object is up to double your size and weight, you will need to perform a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Test]] to try to lift and carry it. Anything larger or heavier and you will not be able to lift it without help that, with combined weight and size, can once again beat the object's own weight and size.
###### [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/History Skill\|History Skill]] (Might)
* Recall oral stories, legends, customs, religions, or other historical info that existed or occurred more than 5 years ago. This knowledge can include battles, heroes, politics, etc.
* Recall beliefs of religions more than 5 years old.
* Recall and perform traditions or traditional ceremonies with accuracy and the acceptance of those familiar with such rites.
###### [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Rumor Skill\|Rumor Skill]] (Artifice)
* Recall current events (within the last 5 years.) Recall modern prominent figures. Recall modern customs, conspiracies, secrets, and the inner workings of governments, factions, and new-age religions.
* Blend in with the locals or conform to etiquette. When interacting with a class of society with which your character has little experience, you may need to roll with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]].
* Search a town for trustworthy merchants, local establishments, or leads on info about a subject. Find a fence or secret group located in the area.
###### [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Tinkering Skill\|Tinkering Skill]] (Artifice)
- Craft, alter, dissect, or dismantle things at a physical level.
- Disarm or alter a trap or mechanism.
- Craft small, crude constructions from raw materials or perform unskilled or crude surgeries. (More complex tinkering in these areas may require specific tools and supplies or multiple [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Test\|Tests]] in a row.)
###### [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Conjuring Skill\|Conjuring Skill]] (Tuning)
* Recall information about magic that involves conjuring. This includes spells that call forth the elements out of thin air, summon entities from beyond, and bring forth images in the mind.
* Recall information about animals, plants, and other living things and their innate, natural or magical abilities. This includes gods and primordial beings, such as elementals, demons, fiends, celestials, and arch-fey, provided that they did not rise to their position.
* When inspecting an active magical effect or the afterimage of a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Spell Ability\|Spell]] that was cast in the last hour, you may learn what cast the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Spell Ability\|Spell]] or what last used a magic item.
###### [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Enchanting Skill\|Enchanting Skill]] (Tuning)
* Recall information about magic that involves enchanting creatures and objects. This includes spells that buff or debuff existing objects and creatures. It also includes charms and the creation of magic items.
* Recall information about unnatural creatures, such as aberrations, cursed beings, and unnaturally ascended beings. This includes gods and other entities that have been warped or modified from their natural state.
* When inspecting an active magical effect or the afterimage of a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Spell Ability\|Spell]] that was cast in the last hour, you may learn what the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Spell Ability\|Spell]] or magic item last targeted.

> [!info] Gods
> When recalling knowledge of gods and their realms using [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Conjuring Skill\|Conjuring]] or [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Enchanting Skill\|Enchanting]], you will not, by default, recall the customs or beliefs of a cult tied to the god, nor the cult's customs or followers. For that, you'll need to use [[#^History]] or [[#^Rumor]].

> [!gm] GM Note: Conjuring vs Enchanting
> The differences between [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Conjuring Skill\|Conjuring]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Enchanting Skill\|Enchanting]] can be hard to tease out at first. Simply try to do your best.
> 
> Often a creature could fall into both categories, but the information gleaned would be different from each. For example, studying a fairy may lead a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Conjuring Skill\|Conjurer]] to facts about that fairy's origins, what types of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Conjuring Skill\|Conjuration]] magic it can wield, along with a few natural weakness or strengths. An [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Enchanting Skill\|Enchanter]] studying the same fairy may instead learn if that fairy was twisted in any way by the shadowy-void regions of the feywild. They may also learn what [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Enchanting Skill\|Enchantments]] the creature can cast or if it has any weaknesses or strengths that it gained by some unnatural means.
> 
> Again, simply do your best, figure out a vibe that works for you and keeps the two [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Skill\|Skills]] fairly balanced.

> [!Info] [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Game Master\|GM]] Tip: Players guessing the wrong skill
> Note that some knowledge -- like [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/History Skill\|History]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Rumor Skill\|Rumor]] -- may be unclear to new players. If a player guesses the wrong skill, simply direct them to the correct [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Knowledge Skill\|Knowledge Skill]] rather than punishing a player's naivete.
> 
> > [!eg] Example:
> > "Can I roll [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/History Skill\|History]] to see if I know anything about the cultists?"
> > "We know this is a newer cult... Roll [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Rumor Skill\|Rumor]] instead."

## Archetype Stats
Below all of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Skill\|Exploration Skills]], you will find your three [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype Stat\|Archetype Stats]]: [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fighter Stat\|Fighter]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Rogue Stat\|Rogue]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Mage Stat\|Mage]].

These three stats are used most often when performing [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] and will even be copied directly over onto the second page of your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]], the [[SRD/Part 2 Character Sheet/07 Abilities Page\|07 Abilities Page]].

Each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Archetype Stat\|Archetype Stat]] starts equal to the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Exploration Stat\|Exploration Stat]] in its same column ([[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Fighter Stat\|Fighter]] equal to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Might Stat\|Might]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Rogue Stat\|Rogue]] equal to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Artifice Stat\|Artifice]], and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Mage Stat\|Mage]] equal to [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Tuning Stat\|Tuning]].)

## References

It is helpful to know more concrete limits and capabilities of your character. The **References** section lists pre-calculated values of what your character can and cannot achieve.
##### Size
Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Size\|Size]] affects how you will interact with several mechanics of the game. There are 6 core [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Size\|Sizes]]. Below is a table of each [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Size\|Size]] along with examples and a unit reference of how big of an area they can block, in-case you are not playing with [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Theater of the Mind\|Theater of the Mind]]:

| **Size**   | **Reference**            | **Units** (m) | **Units** (ft.) |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| Tiny       | Spider, Chicken, Raccoon | 1 by 1        | 2Â½ by 2Â½ ft.    |
| Small      | Capybara, Panda, Wolf    | 2 by 2        | 5 by 5 ft.      |
| Medium     | Donkey, Pig, Emu         | 2 by 2        | 5 by 5 ft.      |
| Large      | Cow, Moose               | 3 by 3        | 10 by 10 ft.    |
| Huge       | Elephant, Giraffe        | 4 by 4        | 15 by 15 ft.    |
| Gargantuan | Whale Shark, Blue Whale  | 6 by 6        | 20 by 20 ft.    |
A creature can always use [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]] to pass through the space of a creature more than one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Size\|Size]] larger or smaller. If a creature using the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Basic Abilities/Grapple\|Grapple Ability]] is the same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Size\|Size]] or larger than you, they may gain an extra effect.
##### Walk Range
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distance]] you can walk on one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] if an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]]. Your starting [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Walk\|Walk]] is [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Spitting Distance]] (or 4 units. See [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics\|Part 1]] > [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/04 Phases of Play\|04 Phases of Play]] > [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/04 Phases of Play#Movement\|Movement]] and the appendix entry for [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Walk\|Walk]].)
##### Jump Range
The [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Distance]] you can jump on one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Turn\|Turn]] if an [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Encounter\|Encounter]]. Your starting [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]] is [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Distance\|Swinging Distance]] (or 1 units. See [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics\|Part 1]] > [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/04 Phases of Play\|04 Phases of Play]] > [[SRD/Part 1 Core Mechanics/04 Phases of Play#Movement\|Movement]] and the appendix entry for [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges/Jump\|Jump]].)
##### Other References
A blank spot is provided alongside the other references to list other [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Limits]] from the [[SRD/Appendix/Movement Ranges\|Movement Range List]] appendix that you may pick up through gaining various [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]]. If you do not need this blank spot for an extra [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement Range\|Movement Range]], feel free to use it for other reference values you may have a hard time remembering.
