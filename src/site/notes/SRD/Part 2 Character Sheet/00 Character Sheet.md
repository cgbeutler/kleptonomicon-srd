Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] consists of three pages. The first two pages are used primarily while playing the game and the last page helps in build and improve your character between sessions of play.

Here in Part 2, we will go over each page and section of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] to explain when, where, and how it will all be used. In reviewing the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] we will also exploring the remaining rules of the game that relate to each section of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]].

If you wish to follow along as you read, you can print the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]] found in the <!--TODO: Add Link--> appendix and refer to it with each chapter (though each chapter will also include an image of the section to which it is referring.)

Below is an overview each page of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Character Sheet\|Character Sheet]]:
