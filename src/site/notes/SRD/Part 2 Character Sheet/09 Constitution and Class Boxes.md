On **Page 3** you will also find the **Constitution** and **Class** boxes.

## Constitution
When creating your character, you will need to choose a starting [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Constitution\|SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Constitution]] from the [[SRD/Appendix/Constitutions/_TODO_\|SRD/Appendix/Constitutions/_TODO_]]. This represents the key physical makeup of your character and grants you starting [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] that help represent that. Your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Constitution\|SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Constitution]] will often alter your [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Health\|Health]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Defense\|Defenses]], [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Movement\|Movement]], and more.

You can also, optionally, choose a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Lineage\|Lineage]] from those listed in the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Constitution\|Constitution]]. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Lineage\|Lineage]] represents a historical lineage or trope, such as "Human," "Elf," etc. More practically, a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Lineage\|Lineage]] is a recipe of [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Trait Ability\|Trait Abilities]] that work well together and mechanically help represent your character's background.

If you wish to play a simple, human-like character, use the "[[SRD/Appendix/Constitutions/Mortal\|Mortal Constitution]]" and the "[[SRD/Appendix/Constitutions/Mortal#Human\|Human Lineage]]".

In the **Constitution Box**, note your chosen [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Constitution\|SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Constitution]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Lineage\|Lineage]] at the top. Below that will go all of your chosen [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Trait Ability\|Trait Abilities]]. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Trait Ability\|Trait Abilities]] can be found in the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Trait Abilities\|Trait Ability List]].

## Class
When creating your character, you will also need to choose a starting [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]]. This represents the main course of training and background for your character. When choosing new [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class Ability\|Class Abilities]], you will need to make sure that you have chosen more [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class Ability\|Class Abilities]] from your chosen [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]] than from any other one [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]].

You can also, optionally, choose a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Subclass\|Subclass]] from those listed at the bottom of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]]. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Subclass\|Subclass]] represents a more specialized version of the [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]], focusing on a more stylized set of capabilities. A [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Subclass\|Subclass]] can help guide you in choosing [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class Ability\|Class Abilities]] that work well together and make sense with your character's background.

In the **Class Box**, note your chosen [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Subclass\|Subclass]] at the top. Below that will go all of your chosen [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class Ability\|Class Abilities]]. [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class Ability\|Class Abilities]] can be found in the [[SRD/Appendix/Abilities/Class Abilities\|Class Ability List]] for your chosen [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Class\|Class]].


> [!gm] GM Note: Requiring Lineages
> If you are playing with a lot of players or in a more strict setting, it can be difficult to ensure that players don't overlap in choosing the same [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]]. In such cases, it may be helpful to require your players to choose a [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Lineage\|Lineage]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Subclass\|Subclass]] and require that at least half of their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Ability\|Abilities]] come from their [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Lineage\|Lineage]] and [[SRD/Appendix/Glossary/Subclass\|Subclass]]. This can help limit overlap and ensure all players have their own, more unique set of capabilities.
